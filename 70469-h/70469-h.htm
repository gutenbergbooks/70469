<p class="ph2">Papa Bouchard</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON a certain day in June, 1901, a
cataclysm occurred in the quiet
apartment of Mademoiselle Céleste
Bouchard, in the Rue Clarisse, the
quietest street in the quietest part of
Paris. This cataclysm consisted of the
simultaneous departure, or rather the
levanting, of the entire masculine element
in the excellent old lady’s household.
And this masculine element had
been so admirably trained! Monsieur
Paul Bouchard, in particular, ten years
his sister’s junior, was reckoned a
model man. Mademoiselle could truly
say that during Monsieur Bouchard’s
fifty-four years of life he had never,
until then, given her a moment’s anxiety.
All the elderly ladies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Bouchards’ acquaintance pointed with
admiration to Monsieur Paul.</p>

<p>“Look!” they said; “such a good
brother! Mademoiselle boasts that
although he is fifty-four years of age
he is still as obedient to her as he was
at fifteen. So prosperous and respected
as an advocate, too!” And
all these ladies sighed because they had
not succeeded in petticoating a brother
or a husband as Mademoiselle Bouchard
had petticoated the prosperous
and respected Monsieur Paul Bouchard.</p>

<p>Pierre, the husband of Élise, Mademoiselle
Bouchard’s maid for thirty
years, was as well disciplined as his
master, for he was Monsieur Paul’s
valet. He had never had a will of his
own since the day, thirty years before,
when Élise had sworn before the
altar to love, honor and obey him.</p>

<p>The third masculine creature in the
dovecote of the Rue Clarisse was the
parrot, Pierrot. Nobody knew exactly
how old Pierrot was, but he was supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
to have arrived at years of discretion.
Mademoiselle had spent a
dozen patient years in curing Pierrot
of a propensity to bad language, and
she had taught him a great variety of
moral maxims that made him a model
bird, as Monsieur Bouchard was a
model man and Pierre a model servant.
It is true that Léontine de Meneval,
Monsieur Paul’s ward, married to a
handsome scapegrace captain of artillery,
had amused herself with teaching
the bird a number of phrases, such as
“Bad boy Bouchard” and others reflecting
on “Papa Bouchard,” as she
called him. And Pierrot had picked
up these naughty expressions with
astonishing quickness. But Léontine
had always been regarded as incorrigible
by her guardian and his sister, although
they really loved her, and since her
marriage she had become gayer, merrier
and more irresponsible than ever. This
deterioration both Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Bouchard laid at the door of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
her husband, Captain de Meneval, with
his laughing eyes and devil-may-care
manner; with whom, however, aside
from these characteristics, not the
slightest fault could be found. He was
devoted to Léontine, and if the two
chose to lead a life as merry and unreflecting
as that of the birds in the
shadowy forests, nobody could stop
them. Papa Bouchard—as the artillery
captain had the impudence to call
him—did, it is true, keep a tight hand
on Léontine’s fortune, and would allow
her only half her income, at which
Léontine grumbled and incited Captain
de Meneval to grumble, too. But
Papa Bouchard, having full power as
trustee, met their complaints and protests
with a proposition to cut down
their allowance to one-fourth of their
income, at which the two young people
grew frightened, and desisted.</p>

<p>Now, there dwells in every masculine
breast a germ of lawlessness that no
discipline ever invented can wholly kill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Man or parrot, it is the same. After
having been brought up in the way he
should go, he longs to go it. Such was
the case with Pierrot, with Pierre
and with Monsieur
Bouchard.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_005">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="It was the bird who made the first dash
for liberty">
</figure>

<p>It was the bird
that first made a
dash for liberty.
After ten years of irreproachable conduct,
Pierrot, on that June morning,
suddenly jumped from the balcony,
where he had been walking the railing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
in the most sedate manner, and scuttled
off in the direction of the Alcazar d’Été,
the Ambassadeurs, the Moulin Rouge,
and the very gayest quarter of Paris.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard was sitting on
the balcony at the time. He was
rather younger looking, with his clean-shaven
face and wiry figure, than most
men of his age, but thanks to Mademoiselle
Céleste, he patronized the same
tailors that had made for his father
and his grandfather. Their cut and
style indicated that they had been tailors
to Cardinal Richelieu and others of that
time, and they dressed Monsieur Bouchard
in coats and trousers and waistcoats
of the pliocene age of tailoring.
As for his hats, they might have been
dug out of Pompeii, for any modernity
they had, and the result was that Monsieur
Bouchard’s back and legs looked
about seventy-five, while his face looked
little more than forty.</p>

<p>Instead of giving the alarm when
Pierrot trotted gaily off, Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Bouchard felt a strange thrill of sympathy
with the runaway.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” thought he. “No
doubt he is sick of the Rue Clarisse—tired
of the moral maxims—weary
of the whole business.
He isn’t so young as he was,
but there’s a good deal of
life in him still”—Pierrot
was just scampering around
the corner—“and he wants
to see life.”</p>

<p>“There is a psychologic
moment for everything,” so
Otto von Bismarck said. The
parrot’s escape made a psychologic
moment for Monsieur
Bouchard, and quietly putting on his
hat, and telling Mademoiselle Bouchard
that he was going to a meeting of
the Society of French Antiquarians at
St. Germains, and afterward for a
stroll through the museum in the
town, made straight for a street
in the neighborhood of the Champs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Élysées. He remembered seeing in
that quarter a handsome new apartment
house lately finished and thoroughly
modern. He had for curiosity’s
sake entered it. He had seen furnished
apartments so bright, so light,
so cheery, so merry that he longed to
establish himself there. He had gone
back once, twice, thrice, each time
more infatuated with the place. To-day
he walked in, selected a vacant
apartment, and in ten minutes had
taken a lease of it for a year.</p>

<p>And then he had to go back to the
Rue Clarisse to tell about it.</p>

<p>Of course, he had not thrown off
the yoke of thirty years without secret
alarms, agitations and palpitations. He
walked up and down the Rue Clarisse
twice, his heart thumping loudly against
his ribs, before he could screw up resolution
to enter. He was nerved, however,
by the recollection of the apartment
he had just seen; it had been given up
the day before by a young journalist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
named Marsac, who had left various
souvenirs of a very pleasant life there.
The street was such a bustling, noisy
street—and the Rue Clarisse was so
quiet, so quiet! In the new street there
were two music halls in full view and
generally in full blast, gay restaurants
blazing with lights, where all sorts of
delicious, indigestible things to eat were
to be had, and such an atmosphere of
jollity and movement! Monsieur Bouchard
quivered with delight like a schoolboy
as he thought of it, and so he marched
in to take his life in his hand while
breaking the news to his sister Céleste.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard, a small,
prim, devoted, affectionate, obstinate
creature, was sitting in the drawing-room,
bemoaning with Élise the loss of
Pierrot. Élise, a hard-featured, hard-working
creature, had such a profound
contempt for the other sex that it was
a wonder she ever brought herself to
marry one of them. She was saying to
Mademoiselle Bouchard:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Depend on it, Mademoiselle, that
ungrateful Pierrot will never come back
of his own accord. If he had been a
she bird, now—but Pierrot is like the
rest of his sex. It’s in them to run
away—and run away they will.”</p>

<p>“He has had a quiet, peaceful home
in the Rue Clarisse for seventeen years,”
wailed poor Mademoiselle Bouchard.</p>

<p>“That’s reason enough for him to
run away. What does he care about a
quiet, peaceful home? He wants to
be strutting around in some restaurant,
drinking and swearing and turning night
into day. They’re all like that. My
Pierre, now, is just as ready to run away
as was Pierrot, but I shall keep an eye
on <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11-12]</span></p>

<p class="caption">With an affectation of ease and debonairness, and told about the apartment

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>And then Monsieur Bouchard walked
in, with an affectation of case and
debonairness, and told about the apartment
near the Champs Élysées, whereat
it seemed to poor Mademoiselle Céleste
as if the Louvre had moved itself over
into the Bois de Boulogne and the Seine
had suddenly begun to flow backward.
Of course, Monsieur Bouchard had arranged
a plausible tale by which his
hegira was to appear the most natural
and laudable thing in the world. Most
men are inventive enough in the matter
of personal justification. But it is
one thing to make up and tell a
plausible tale, and another to get that
tale believed. Élise openly sniffed at
the theory advanced by Monsieur Bouchard
that it was absolutely necessary
for him to live nearer the courts. Also,
that he was really inspired by a desire
to save Mademoiselle the annoyance of
clients coming and going.</p>

<p>“You remember, my dear Céleste,
you complained of Captain de Meneval
the last time he was here. You said he
talked and laughed so much, and chucked
Élise under the chin——”</p>

<p>“But that was a trifle; you know
there’s no real harm done,” protested
Mademoiselle Bouchard.</p>

<p>“Why? Because I won’t let him,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
said Monsieur Bouchard, with the determined
air a man assumes when he
wishes to impress a woman with a
great notion of the power he holds
over another man. “It is because he
has to deal with <i>me</i>—a man born
with his shirt on, as the peasants say.
Otherwise, there might be harm done.
De Meneval is very saucy. When I
reminded him the other day of the
promise I exacted from him when he
married Léontine, that he wouldn’t
go into debt, the fellow grinned and
said he was in love with Léontine,
and would have promised to eat his
grandmother if I had made that a
condition.”</p>

<p>“But in reference to this strange
notion of yours about taking an apartment
at your time of life——”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, my dear,” cried
Monsieur Bouchard. “I am too old
not to have a separate establishment.”</p>

<p>“Too old!” cried Mademoiselle,
who had never ceased to regard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
model Monsieur Bouchard as a wild
sprig of flamboyant youth; “you mean
too young!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard was tickled.
What gentleman of fifty-four is not
pleased at the assumption that he is
merely a colt, after all?</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard anxiously
scrutinized her brother. There was a
lawless gleam in his eye—an indefinable
something that is revealed when a
man has the bit between his teeth and
does not mean to let it go. Mademoiselle,
good, innocent soul, was not devoid
of sense, and she saw her only game
was to play for time.</p>

<p>“Very well, Paul. If you <i>will</i> desert
the Rue Clarisse, I will look about
and get you an apartment near by, and
I will let you have Pierre——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Monsieur Bouchard,
hastily. He had no mind to
have a domestic Vidocq in his new
quarters. “I couldn’t think of robbing
you of Pierre. Thirty years you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
have had him. You could not get on
without him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could.”</p>

<p>“I can’t accept the sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“I make it cheerfully for your sake.”</p>

<p>“It would be cruel to Pierre.”</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> will make the sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“That he will,” interrupted Élise,
with the freedom of an old servant.
“He will caper at the notion of leaving
the Rue Clarisse for some wild,
dissipated place such as Monsieur Paul
has selected.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Paul has not selected a
place, Élise,” replied Mademoiselle,
with severity.</p>

<p>“But—but I have, my dear Céleste.
It is No. 25 Rue Bassano. I have
taken it for a year. In fact, the van
is coming to-day for my personal belongings.
Pierre will see to them.
And, my dear, I have a busy day before
me. I am due at the meeting of the
Society of French Antiquarians at St.
Germains at one o’clock, and I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
barely make the train. Afterward I
shall spend some instructive hours in
the museum—I shall see you to-morrow—”
and Monsieur Bouchard literally
ran out of the room.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” apostrophized
Élise to Mademoiselle Céleste, who
was almost in tears. “That’s the
way Pierrot scampered off, and Pierre
wants only half a wink to run off, too,
to the Rue Bassano.”</p>

<p>“Élise,” cried Mademoiselle, “you
are most unjust, and your suspicions of
Pierre will be disproved. Ring the
bell.”</p>

<p>Pierre appeared.</p>

<p>He was about Monsieur Bouchard’s
age, height and size—medium in
all respects—clean shaven, like his
master, and wore a cast-off suit of
Monsieur Bouchard’s, as it was the
morning and his livery was religiously
saved for the afternoon. He was, in
short, a very good replica of Monsieur
Bouchard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Mademoiselle Bouchard stated the
case to him, carefully giving Monsieur
Paul’s bogus reasons.</p>

<p>“The Rue Bassano is a very gay
and noisy place, Pierre, as you know,
with a great many theatres and restaurants
about, and much passing to
and fro. It will be a change from the
Rue Clarisse.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I know it,” Pierre
replied, showing the whites of his eyes.
“I would much rather remain in this
decent, quiet street.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle turned to Élise with
an I-told-you-so air, and said, “No
doubt you would, Pierre—a man of
your excellent character.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mademoiselle. The theatres
and music halls must be very objectionable—and
the restaurants. I suppose
the waiters would laugh at me
when I went to fetch Monsieur’s dinner
of boiled mutton and rice.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but if it were your duty to
go with Monsieur?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Duty, Mademoiselle, has ever been
a sacred word with me. Though but
a servant, I have always revered my
duty,” replied the virtuous Pierre. He
backed and filled for some time longer,
as servants commonly do—and as
some of their masters and mistresses do
sometimes—but finally, in response
to Mademoiselle Bouchard’s pleading
that he would not desert Monsieur
Bouchard at this critical moment in his
career, consented to brave the dangers
of the gay Rue Bassano. But when
Mademoiselle hinted at the horrid possibility
that Monsieur Bouchard might
be beguiled into sowing a late crop of
wild oats, suddenly a grin flashed for a
moment on Pierre’s stolid countenance—flashed
and disappeared so instantly
that Mademoiselle Bouchard was not
sure he grinned at all. If he did, however,
it must have been at the notion
that the staid, the correct Monsieur
Bouchard could ever sow wild oats.
Mademoiselle Céleste blushed faintly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
at the thought that she reckoned such
a thing possible.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_020">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="He stood on one leg, and softly whispered,
“Houp-là!”">
</figure>

<p>Pierre then backed out of the door,
wiping two imaginary tears from his
eyes. Once outside with the door
shut, this miscreant did a very strange
thing. He stood on one leg, whirled
around with the greatest agility for his
years, and softly whispered, “Houp-là!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>That very day came the moving.
The van arrived, and Monsieur Bouchard’s
books, papers and clothes were
put into it by Pierre, who seemed to be
in the deepest dejection. Mademoiselle
gave him minute and tearful directions
about Monsieur Paul’s diet, exercise
and clothing. He was to see that
Monsieur Paul kept regular hours, and
was to report in the Rue Clarisse the
smallest infraction of the rules of living
which might occur in the Rue Bassano;
and Pierre promised with a fervor and
glibness that would have excited the
suspicions of anyone less kindly and
simple-minded than good old Mademoiselle.
He did indeed awaken a host of
doubts in the mind of his faithful Élise,
who had not been married for thirty
years without finding out a few things
about men. And when he wept at
telling her good-bye for a single day,
she told him not to be shedding any of
those crocodile tears around her.</p>

<p>Pierre, mounted on the van that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
carried away Monsieur Bouchard’s
belongings, drove off, looking as melancholy
as he could; but as soon as he
turned the corner he began whistling
so merrily that the driver asked him
if his uncle hadn’t died and left him
some money.</p>

<p>When the Rue Bassano was reached
Pierre jumped down and skipped up
stairs with the agility of twenty instead
of fifty. He was as charmed with
Monsieur’s new apartment as Monsieur
himself had been. It was so
intensely modern. Light everywhere—all
sorts of new-fashioned conveniences—nothing
in the least like the
dismal old Rue Clarisse. And the view
from the windows—so very gay! And
the noise—so delicious, so intoxicatingly
interesting! The sound of rag
time music came from the two music
halls across the way. Pierre, dropping
all pretence of work, was inspired to
do the <i>can-can</i>, whistling and singing
meanwhile. The open window proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
so attractive that Pierre spent a good
part of the time hanging out of it, and
only by fits and starts got Monsieur
Bouchard’s belongings in place. And
the more he saw of the place, the more
exuberant was his delight with it, and
the more determined he was to stay
there. The last tenant—the jolly
young journalist named Marsac—had
left, as Monsieur Bouchard had noted,
some souvenirs on the walls in the shape
of gaudy posters and brilliant chromos
of ballet girls. These, Pierre might be
expected to remove when he began to
hang on the walls the severely classic
pictures that constituted Monsieur Bouchard’s
collection of art. But Pierre
seemed to know by clairvoyance Monsieur
Bouchard’s latent tastes. He
hung “The Coliseum by Moonlight”—a
very fine etching—immediately
under a red-and-gold young lady who
was making a quarter past six with her
dainty, uplifted toe. “Socrates and His
Pupils” were put where they could get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
an admirable view of another red-and-gold
young lady who was making twelve
o’clock meridian as nearly as a human
being could. “Kittens at Play”—a
great favorite of Mademoiselle’s—was
side by side with a picture of Courier,
who won the Grand Prix that year,
and a very noble portrait of President
Loubet was placed next a cut of a
celebrated English prize fighter, stripped
for the ring. The remainder of the
things were neatly arranged; the <i>concierge</i>,
who was to supply Monsieur
Bouchard’s meals, was interviewed, and
an appetizing dinner ordered. Then
Pierre, taking possession of the evening
newspaper and also of a very comfortable
chair by the window, awaited
Monsieur Bouchard’s arrival.</p>

<p>It was a charming evening in the
middle of June, and still broad daylight
at seven o’clock. But Pierre, presently
lighting a lamp and drawing the shades,
gave the apartment a homelike and
inviting aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Just as the clock struck seven Monsieur
Bouchard’s step was heard on the
stair. Seven o’clock had been Monsieur
Bouchard’s hour of coming home
since he was fifteen years old, and he
had never varied from it three minutes
in thirty-seven years. He entered the
drawing-room with a new and jovial
air, but when he saw Pierre his countenance
turned as black as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he
asked, curtly.</p>

<p>“I came, Monsieur, by Mademoiselle’s
orders,” civilly replied Pierre.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle’s orders” was still a
phrase to conjure by with Monsieur
Bouchard. When the yoke of forty
years is thrown off there is still a feeling
as if it were bearing on the neck.
Monsieur Bouchard threw his gloves
crossly on the table and asked for his
dinner.</p>

<p>“It will be here in five minutes,
Monsieur,” replied Pierre. “Will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Monsieur look about the apartment and
see if I have arranged things to suit
him? The pictures, for example?”</p>

<p>Monsieur, still sulky, rose, and the
first thing his eye fell on was the prize
fighter’s portrait under President Loubet’s.</p>

<p>“This is intolerable!” he said, indignantly.
“Why didn’t you take
this prize-fighting daub down?”</p>

<p>“Because,” readily responded Pierre,
“the place where it was would be
marked on the wall; and besides, I
did not like to take the liberty without
Monsieur’s permission.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard passed on to
the next picture, that of the hero of
the Grand Prix. He liked horses—in
pictures, that is—and really found
Courier more to his taste than “Kittens
at Play.” His countenance
cleared, and when Pierre gravely directed
him to the young lady poised
on one toe and reaching skyward with
the other, a faint smile actually appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
on Monsieur Bouchard’s face.
Then, his eye falling on the other young
lady who was trying to make twelve
o’clock meridian, every wrinkle on his
forehead smoothed out, his mouth came
open like a rat trap, and he involuntarily
assumed an attitude of pleased contemplation,
with his hands under his
coat tails.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, it flashed on him
that Mademoiselle Bouchard’s paid detective,
in the person of Pierre, was
eyeing him, and with the quickness of
thought Monsieur Bouchard’s appreciative
smile gave way to a portentous
frown, and turning to Pierre, he said,
sternly:</p>

<p>“Take this thing away! It is reprehensible
both in art and morals! I
can’t have it here!”</p>

<p>But, wonder of wonders! there
stood Pierre, his mouth wide open in
a silent guffaw, his left eye nearly
closed. Was it possible that he was
daring to wink at his master? Pierre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
however, pretty soon solved the situation
by putting his finger on the
side of his nose—a shocking familiarity—and
saying, roguishly:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_028">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="Pierre, however, pretty soon solved the situation
by putting his finger to the side
of his nose">
</figure>

<p>“Ah, sir, I have something to say
to you. I was forced, yes, actually
driven, from the decorous quiet of the
Rue Clarisse and the company of Mademoiselle
Bouchard and my worthy
Élise and the cats, to this gay locality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
by my solicitude for Monsieur. That
is to say, Mademoiselle thinks I was.
One thing is certain—I was sent here
to cake care of Monsieur. Well, it
depends entirely on Monsieur how I
take care of him. Do you understand,
sir?”</p>

<p>“N—n—not exactly.” Monsieur
Bouchard was a little frightened. Having
Pierre to mount guard over him
seemed destructive of the harmless
liberty and mild gaiety he had promised
himself in the Rue Bassano.</p>

<p>“Just this, sir. My wife, I have
reason to know, expects Monsieur to
watch me and report to her. Mademoiselle
expects me to watch Monsieur
and report to <i>her</i>. Now, what prevents
us from each giving a good account
of the other, and meanwhile
doing as we please?”</p>

<p>Monsieur for a moment looked indignant
at this impudent proposition,
coming, too, as it did from a servant
whom he had known as the pattern of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
decorum for thirty years. But only
for a moment. Was it strange, after
all, that thirty years of the Rue Clarisse
had bred a spirit of revolt in
this hitherto obedient husband and
submissive servant?</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_030">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="I like the lively tunes they play at the
music halls across the street">
</figure>

<p>Pierre, seeing evidences of yielding
on the part of Monsieur, proceeded to
clinch the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“You see, sir, I found out you were
looking at this apartment. If I had
told Mademoiselle what I knew about
it there’d have been a pretty kettle of
fish. I doubt if Monsieur would have
got away from the Rue Clarisse alive.
But I didn’t. I concluded the Rue
Bassano was a very pleasant place to
live. I like the lively tunes they play
at the music halls across the street, and
that theatre round the corner is convenient.
But I never should have got
away if I had showed how much I
wanted to come. When Mademoiselle
proposed it to me, I lied like a trooper.
I not only lied, but I cried, at the prospect
of leaving the Rue Clarisse. That
settled it. A woman is like a pig. If
you want to drive her to Orleans, you
must head her for Strasburg. So here
we are, sir, and if we don’t have a livelier
time here than we did in the Rue
Clarisse it will be Monsieur’s fault, not
mine.”</p>

<p>Monsieur met this outrageous speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
by saying, “You are the most impudent,
scandalous, scheming, hypocritical
rascal I ever met——”</p>

<p>Pierre just then heard sounds in the
little lobby which he understood. He
ran out and returned with a tray, which
he placed on the table, already laid for
one. Then, arranging the dishes with
a great flourish, he invited Monsieur
Bouchard to take his place at the table.
Monsieur complied. The first course
was oysters—at three francs the dozen.
Then there was turtle soup; devilled
lobster, duckling <i>à la Bordelaise</i>—both
of which were forbidden in the Rue
Clarisse, because Monsieur Bouchard
at the age of seven had been made
ill by them—and a bottle of champagne,
a wine that Mademoiselle had
always told her brother was poison to
every member of his family.</p>

<p>But Monsieur Bouchard seemed to
forget all about this. He ate and
drank these things as if he had forgotten
all his painful experiences of forty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
years before and as if he had been
brought up on champagne.</p>

<p>It was rather pleasant—this first
quaff of liberty—having what he liked
to eat and drink, and even to wear.
He privately determined before finishing
his dinner that he would get a new
tailor next day and have some clothes
made in the latest fashion.</p>

<p>“Have you found out the names of
any persons in the house?” asked Monsieur
after dinner, lighting a cigar. It
was his second; in the Rue Clarisse
he was limited to one.</p>

<p>“No one at all, sir,” replied that
double-dyed villain, Pierre. “It isn’t
judicious to know all sorts of people.
I intend to forget some I know.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard turned in his
chair and looked at Pierre; the fellow
really seemed changed into another
man from what he had been for thirty
years. But to Monsieur Bouchard the
change was not displeasing. He felt
a bond between himself and Pierre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
stronger in the last half-hour than in
the thirty years they had been master
and man. They exchanged looks—it
might even be said winks—and Monsieur
Bouchard poured out another
glass of champagne—his third. And
what with the wine and the dinner, he
was in that state of exhilaration which
the sense of liberty newly acquired always
brings.</p>

<p>“Monsieur won’t want me any more
to-night?” asked Pierre.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Monsieur Bouchard,
“but—be sure to be here at—” he
meant to say at ten o’clock that night,
but changed his mind and said, “seven
o’clock to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” answered Pierre.
“I expect to be home and in bed before
three.”</p>

<p>And he said this with such a debonair
manner that Monsieur Bouchard
was secretly charmed, and privately
determined to acquire something of the
same tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Pierre gone, Monsieur Bouchard
made himself comfortable in an easychair
and began toying with a fourth
cigar. How agreeable were these modern
apartments, after all—everything
furnished, every want anticipated—all
a tenant had to do was to walk in and
hang up his hat. Then his thoughts
wandered to that very pretty woman
who had travelled in the same train
with him that day to St. Germains, and
the day before to Verneuil, whither he
had gone to look after some property
of Léontine’s. Madame Vernet was
her name—it was on her travelling
bag—and she was a widow—that
fact had leaked out ten seconds after
he met her. But she was so very
demure, so modest, not to say bashful,
that she seemed more like a nun than
a widow. And so timid—everything
frightened her. She trembled when the
guard asked her for her ticket, and
clung quite desperately to Monsieur
Bouchard’s arm in the station at Verneuil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
She had expected her aunt and
uncle to meet her, and when they were
not to be found, blushingly accepted
Monsieur Bouchard’s services in getting
a cab. And that day, on stepping into
the railway carriage to go to St. Germains,
there was the dear little diffident
thing again. She was charmed to see
her friend of the day before, and explained
that she was to spend the day
with another uncle and aunt she had
living at St. Germains. Knowing her
inability to care for herself in a crowd,
Monsieur Bouchard had meant to put
her into a cab, as he had done the day
before. But just as the train stopped
he was seized by a couple of snuffy old
antiquarians and hustled off by them
before he could even offer to take
charge of the quiet, the retiring, the
clinging and helpless Madame Vernet.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard lay back in his
chair recalling her prim but pretty gray
gown, her fleecy veil of gray gauze, that
covered but did not conceal her charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
features, and her extremely natty
boots. He could not for the life of him
remember whether he had mentioned to
her on their first meeting that he was
going to St. Germains next day. While
he was cogitating this point he was
rudely disturbed by the opening of the
door, and Captain de Meneval walked
in briskly.</p>

<p>Now, this good-looking captain of
artillery, who had married Monsieur
Bouchard’s ward, Léontine, was not
exactly to Monsieur’s taste. It is true
he had never been able to find out anything
to de Meneval’s discredit—and
he had looked pretty closely into the
captain’s affairs at the time of Léontine’s
marriage. As for Léontine herself, she
was devoted to her captain and always
represented him as being the kindest as
well as the most agreeable of husbands.
True, he was always complaining about
the modest income that Papa Bouchard
allowed them, but Léontine herself was
ever doing that, and urged de Meneval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
on in his complaints. Monsieur Bouchard
was a little annoyed at de Meneval’s
entrance, especially as the artillery
captain had adopted a hail-fellow-well-met
air, highly objectionable on the
part of a man toward another man who
practically holds the purse-strings for
number one.</p>

<p>Therefore, Monsieur Bouchard rather
stiffly gave Captain de Meneval three
fingers and offered him a chair.</p>

<p>“Changed your quarters, eh?” said
de Meneval, looking about him.
“Found the Rue Clarisse rather slow,
and came off here where you can be
your own man, so to speak?”</p>

<p>“I was not actuated by any such
motive,” coldly replied Monsieur Bouchard.
“I came here because the rooms
I had in the Rue Clarisse were cramped,
and I needed to have more space, as
well as to be in a more convenient quarter
of Paris.”</p>

<p>De Meneval’s bright eyes had been
travelling round the walls, and Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Bouchard remembered, with cold chills
running up and down his back, the pictures
of his predecessor—that scampish
young journalist, Marsac—so indiscreetly
left hanging by Pierre. A shout
of laughter from de Meneval, and a
pointing of his stick toward the red-and-gold
young ladies, showed Monsieur
Bouchard that his apprehensions were
not unfounded.</p>

<p>“Is that your selection, Papa Bouchard?”
cried the reprobate captain.
“Never saw them before—you must
have kept them in hiding in the Rue
Clarisse. I’ll tell Léontine,” and the
captain laughed loudly.</p>

<p>He had a great haw-haw of a laugh
that had always been particularly annoying
to Monsieur Bouchard, and this
thing of calling him “Papa” Bouchard
was an unwarrantable liberty. So he
replied, freezingly:</p>

<p>“You are altogether mistaken.
These extraordinary prints were left
here by my predecessor, a very wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
young journalist—I believe most young
journalists are very wild—and they
come down to-morrow. It would seriously
disturb me to have those ballet
pictures around.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said de Meneval, with
an unabashed front, “I think you are
too hard on the poor girls. I have
known a good many of them in my life—taken
them to little suppers, you
know—and generally they’re very
hard-working, decent girls. Some of
them have a husband and children to
help to support. Others have dependent
parents. They’re unconventional—very—and
like to eat and drink at
somebody else’s expense, but that’s no
great harm. Plenty of other people in
much higher walks of life do the same.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to discuss ballet girls
with you, Monsieur de Meneval,” remarked
Monsieur Bouchard, with great
dignity.</p>

<p>“But I want to discuss them with
<i>you</i>,” answered de Meneval, with what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Monsieur Bouchard thought most improper
levity and familiarity. “That’s
what I came to you this evening about.
That’s why I have been haunting the
Rue Clarisse during the last ten days,
trying to see you alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know that I have been
honored with a good many cards of
yours. Also of Léontine’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Léontine! You may be sure
she does not come on the errand that
brings me. While she feels the narrowness
of our income as much as I
do, she manages to live within her
allowance, and I don’t believe owes a
franc in the world. But, Papa Bouchard,
to come to business——”</p>

<p>De Meneval paused. He had a good
deal of courage, but the stony silence
with which his confidences were met
would have disconcerted an ogre.</p>

<p>“Go on, Monsieur le Capitaine,”
said Monsieur Bouchard, icily.</p>

<p>“I’m going on. You see, it is just
this way—that is—” de Meneval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
floundered—“as I was going to say—Léontine,
you know, is perfect—it
really is touching to see how she bears
our enforced but unnecessary poverty.
I wish I could do as well.”</p>

<p>Here de Meneval came to a dead
stop, and Monsieur Bouchard, by way
of encouraging him, repeated, in the
same tone:</p>

<p>“Go on, Monsieur le Capitaine.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>can’t</i> go on with you fixing
that basilisk glare on me,” cried de
Meneval, rising and walking about
excitedly. “I believe, if you say, ‘Go
on, Monsieur le Capitaine,’ to me again,
I’ll do something desperate—smash
the mirror with my stick, or turn on
the fire alarm. I assure you, Monsieur
Bouchard, I am still a respectable
member of society. I don’t beat
my wife or cheat at cards, and I have
never committed a felony in my life.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” was Papa Bouchard’s
fatherly reception of this speech.</p>

<p>De Meneval, after walking once or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
twice up and down the room, succeeded
in mastering his indignation,
and sat quietly down in the chair he
had just vacated, facing Monsieur Bouchard,
and then, still floundering awkwardly,
managed to say:</p>

<p>“I—I—am very much in want—I
am, at present—in short, I am in
the most unpleasant predicament.” And
then he mumbled, “Money.”</p>

<p>“So I knew the moment you entered
this room,” was Monsieur Bouchard’s
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Then, sir,” said de Meneval, recovering
his spirits now that the murder
was out, “I wish you had said so in
the beginning. It would have saved
me a very bad quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” severely replied
Monsieur Bouchard, “I had not the
slightest wish to save you a bad quarter
of an hour.”</p>

<p>“So it seems; but I will tell you
just how it stands. You know I am
stationed at Melun——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I have known that fact ever since
I knew you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. There is a music
hall at Melun—the Pigeon House—with
a garden back of it, kept by one
Michaux, a rascal, if ever I saw one.
Now, it’s very dull at Melun the
evenings I am on duty and can’t get
back to Léontine in Paris, and it’s a
small place, and quite naturally, when
one hears the music going at the
Pigeon House, and sees the lights
flashing and the people eating and
drinking under the trees on the terrace
garden, it’s quite natural, I say,
to drop in there for the evening.”</p>

<p>“Quite natural for you, sir. Go
on, Monsieur le Capitaine.”</p>

<p>De Meneval restrained his impulse
to brain Monsieur Bouchard, sitting
so sternly and primly before him, and
kept on:</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45-46]</span>
<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_045">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">And the girls are permitted to come out in their stage costumes, to have an ice
or a glass of wine.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Then there is the garden—jolly
place, with electric lights—where you
can get a pretty fair meal. It is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
unique—nothing like it in Paris or
anywhere else that I can think of,
and I’ve seen a good many—” here
de Meneval hastily checked himself.
“It’s quite the thing to give suppers
to the young ladies of the ballet—and
some of them are not so young, either—in
the gardens. The proprietor,
of course, encourages it, and the girls
are permitted to come out in their
stage costumes to have an ice or a
glass of wine. All the fellows in my
regiment do it; it’s considered quite
the thing, and their mothers and sisters
come out to the Pigeon House to see
them do it. If it wasn’t for the
support given the place by the garrison
it would have to close up, and
then Melun would be duller than ever.
The Pigeon House is unconventional,
but perfectly respectable.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” drily replied Monsieur
Bouchard, “but not probably.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, sir! you are mistaken.
Léontine has been teasing me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
for a month past to take her out there
to supper some evening, and I’ve promised
to do so this very next week. Do
you think I’d take my wife to any
place that wasn’t respectable?”</p>

<p>De Meneval was getting warm over
this, and Monsieur Bouchard was forced
to admit that he supposed the Pigeon
House <i>was</i> respectable.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t prevent these
jolly little suppers to the young ladies
of the ballet, and especially those given
to them by the officers. I assure you
it is mere harmless eating and drinking.
The poor girls have to work hard, and
when they get through of an evening
I dare say very few of them have two
francs to buy something to eat. So a
number of us have got into the way of
giving these poor souls supper after the
performance. Even Major Fallière goes
to these suppers, and you know his
nickname in the regiment.”</p>

<p>“No, I know of him only as a very
correct, middle-aged man. I wish you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
had the same sort of reputation as
Major Fallière.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is called by the juniors
old P. M. P.—that is to say, the Pink
of Military Propriety. And Fallière is
my chum, and <i>he</i> goes to these little
suppers.”</p>

<p>De Meneval brought this out with
an air of triumph, but Monsieur Bouchard
remained coldly unresponsive,
and then de Meneval let the cat out
of the bag.</p>

<p>“And I say, Monsieur Bouchard,
the proprietor of the Pigeon House
sent me in my account the other day—nineteen
hundred francs nineteen centimes—and
I haven’t got the money
to pay it.”</p>

<p>De Meneval lay back and waited
for the explosion. Monsieur Bouchard
started from his chair, bawling:</p>

<p>“Nineteen hundred francs! And
you no doubt expect me to pay it out
of your wife’s income! I wonder
what Léontine would say to this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“That’s just what I’ve been wondering,
too,” replied de Meneval, somewhat
dolefully. “Léontine is the dearest
girl in the world, but she is a
woman, after all. I can prove to her
that I have never given a franc’s worth
to any other woman, except something
to eat and drink, but all the same I’d
just as soon she would think I spent
my Melun evenings sitting in my quarters,
with her picture before me and
reading up on ballistics, as an artillery
officer should.”</p>

<p>“And would you deliberately impose
on her innocence in this respect?”
asked Monsieur Bouchard, indignantly.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” calmly replied de
Meneval, “you have never been married.
If you had, you would not talk
about a man’s imposing on his wife’s
innocence. Love is clairvoyant, and
most men know what their wives wish
to believe, and gratify them accordingly.
It’s a very complex subject, and needs
to be dealt with intelligently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“I think our standard of intelligence
is not the same,” grimly responded
Monsieur Bouchard. “But when I
tell Léontine about this nineteen hundred
francs due at the Pigeon House, I
trust she will be able to deal with you
intelligently.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid she will,” replied de
Meneval, with some anxiety; “but after
it’s paid I know I can persuade her
that it was not the least actual harm—just
a little lark in the way of killing
time.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask, since you speak so
confidently of its being paid, whom do
you expect to pay it?”</p>

<p>“You, sir, of course,” replied de
Meneval, taking a cigar out of Monsieur
Bouchard’s case.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard jumped as if a hornet
had stung him. “I, sir? Since
you have assumed this modest expectation,
perhaps you anticipate that I will
pay it out of my private income?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I mean out of my wife’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
income,” replied de Meneval, puffing
away at his cigar.</p>

<p>“You are too modest, Monsieur le
Capitaine. Now let me tell you this—you
misunderstood your customer in
bringing this outrageous bill to me, and
it won’t be paid. I have a sincere affection
for Léontine, and I don’t intend
to let any captain of artillery in the
French army, husband or no husband,
make ducks and drakes of her money.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard leaned back, folded
his arms and looked the embodiment of
statuesque determination. Captain de
Meneval puffed a while longer at his
cigar, and then rose. There was resolution,
as if he still held a trump card
to play, written on his countenance.</p>

<p>“Very well, Monsieur Bouchard,”
he said, readjusting the blossom in his
buttonhole. “I am sorry you are so
unyielding. You didn’t ask me if I
was prepared to offer any security that
the loan would be repaid. If you had
I should have given you this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>De Meneval pulled from his pocket
a glittering string of diamonds, every
stone glittering like a star.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_053">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="De Meneval pulled from his pocket a glittering
string of diamonds">
</figure>

<p>“This is the diamond necklace I
gave Léontine on our marriage. Of
course, I could not afford it, but I was
in love with her—I’m more in love
with her now—and I gave her what
would please her, without counting the
cost.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard gasped. “And Léontine—does
she know of this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>De Meneval shook his head. “You
see, when I bought this necklace for
forty thousand francs the jeweller
showed me at the same time an exact
copy of it in paste—seventy-five
francs. He told me when he sold a
necklace like this he usually sold a counterfeit,
for emergencies—you know.
I bought the seventy-five franc necklace,
too—and I didn’t mention it
to Léontine. I think all the philosophers,
beginning with the Egyptian
school of something or other B. C.,
down through the Greeks and the Romans
to Kant and Schopenhauer, agree
that it is not philosophic for a married
man to tell everything to his wife.
So I never told Léontine about this
imitation necklace, but kept it for an
emergency, as the jeweller—a married
man—advised me. To-night,
when I saw I was in a tight place and
had to come to you, I quietly slipped
the paste necklace into the case, which
we keep in our strong-box, and put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
real one into my pocket. I came
within an ace of being caught by
Léontine, though. The dear girl
entered the room a minute afterward
and asked me to get out her diamond
necklace—she was going to the opera
with some friends of hers—and off
she’s gone, glittering with paste, and
as innocent as a lamb, while here is the
real thing.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard was staggered for a
minute or two. Then he said: “So
you expected me to turn amateur
pawnbroker for your benefit?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied de Meneval, stroking
his moustache, “I should not have
put it in that brutally frank fashion
myself, but if you don’t care to act
the amateur pawnbroker, I shall be
obliged to take it to the professionals.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” cried Papa Bouchard.
He really was fond of Léontine, and
didn’t mean to risk her diamonds.
Nevertheless, there was a stand-and-deliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
air about the whole transaction
which vexed him inexpressibly. He sat
silent for a while and so did de Meneval.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, for all that he had
been hectored by a woman all his life,
was yet no fool. He saw that de
Meneval had him in a trap, and reasoned
out the whole thing inside of
two minutes.</p>

<p>“Now, Monsieur le Capitaine,” he
said, presently, “I see where we stand.
I will not lend you the money out of
Léontine’s income—but I will lend it
to you myself. I shall keep this necklace
until the money is paid. Meanwhile,
I shall go out to see this place—the
Pigeon House—and judge for
myself all these facts that you allege.”</p>

<p>“Do!” cried the cheerful reprobate,
with a grin. “Perhaps you’ll like it
and get into the habit of going there.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps,” replied Papa Bouchard,
“I may not like it, and you
may have your income reduced if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
persist in going there. And then—when
the whole transaction is concluded
and the money repaid, I shall
disclose every particular of it to Léontine.”</p>

<p>“By all means!” De Meneval was
actually laughing in Papa Bouchard’s
face. “I’ll deny every word of it, of
course, and call for proof. I’ll tell
Léontine you tried to persuade me to
go out there with you and I refused.
I’ll say <i>you</i> gave the suppers, and I’ll
bring twenty of the best fellows in the
regiment to swear to it—and you’ll see
who comes out ahead in <i>that</i> game.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard was so horrified at
the cold-blooded villainy of this that
he could hardly speak for a minute.
But he refused to take the threat seriously,
and demanding the bill, which
de Meneval promptly produced, said,
stiffly:</p>

<p>“You will hear from me in a day or
two.”</p>

<p>“And how about the advance?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
asked de Meneval, “I should like
about a thousand francs in cash.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard put up his eye-glass
and surveyed Captain de Meneval all
over, which scrutiny was borne with
the greatest coolness by the brazen
captain of artillery.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued de Meneval,
“the story is very liable to get into the
newspapers—<i>extremely</i> liable, I may
say. It will be something like this—that
Monsieur Bouchard held Captain
and Madame de Meneval so tight that
they were compelled to let Monsieur
Bouchard have Madame’s diamond
necklace for a small loan—and the
newspapers will probably make it out
to be Léontine’s wardrobe and my
watch and chain besides.”</p>

<p>De Meneval paused—the fellow
knew when to stop. Monsieur Bouchard,
swelling with rage, paused too—and
then, taking out his cheque book,
angrily wrote a cheque for a thousand
francs, which he handed Captain de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Meneval in exchange for a sheaf of
bills produced by the captain.</p>

<p>“Before paying another franc, I shall
go out to the Pigeon House and investigate
the whole business,” said Monsieur
Bouchard, savagely.</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_059"><img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="“Ta, ta!” called out the graceless dog of
a captain"></div>

<p>“Ta, ta!” called out
the graceless dog of a captain,
picking up his hat.
“Remember, you are on
your good behavior. One
single indiscretion at the
Pigeon House and I’ll
telegraph the whole story
to Mademoiselle Bouchard,
and then——”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard simply
sat and swelled the more
with rage at the unabashed front of this
captain of artillery—but he was galvanized
into motion by a light tap on
the door and a musical voice calling:</p>

<p>“Are you in, Papa Bouchard?”</p>

<p>Although all the fulminations of
Monsieur Bouchard had failed to affect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Captain de Meneval, the sound of that
voice flurried him considerably. For
it was Léontine’s, and de Meneval had
no particular desire for an interview
with her under Papa Bouchard’s basilisk
eye. He turned quite pale, did
this robust captain, and muttered:</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be caught here.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard smiled in a superior
manner—he rather liked the notion of
de Meneval being caught there—and
called out to Léontine:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>M. Bouchard’s hat, cape-greatcoat
and umbrella lay on a chair where he
had placed them on coming in. Without
so much as saying, “By your
leave,” de Meneval slung the greatcoat
round him, clapped Papa Bouchard’s
hat on his head, seized the
umbrella in such a way as to hide his
face, and with his own hat under his
arm opened the door to the lobby and
darted past Léontine, nearly knocking
her down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Léontine, wearing an evening
gown, a long and beautiful white
mantle, and a chiffon scarf over her
head, entered, somewhat discomposed
by her encounter.</p>

<p>“What a very rude man that was
who pushed by me so suddenly!” she
said, advancing. “Some of your tiresome
clients, Papa Bouchard, and I
order you not to have that creature
here again.” And she ran forward
and kissed Papa Bouchard on his bald
head.</p>

<p>Now, it was plain that this pretty
Léontine took liberties with her guardian,
godfather and trustee, and also
that Papa Bouchard liked these liberties.
It was in vain that he tried to
assume a stern air with Léontine.
She pinched his ear when he scolded,
drew caricatures of him when he
frowned, and when at last he was
forced to smile, as he always was,
perched herself on the arm of his chair
and declined to be evicted. And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
was so very pretty! The French have
a saying that the devil himself was
handsome when he was young. Léontine
de Meneval had more than the
mere beauty of youth, of form, of
color. She was the embodiment
of graceful gaiety.
She looked like one of those
brilliant white butterflies
whose lives are spent dancing
in the sun. The great
and glorious dowry of love,
of youth, of beauty, of
health, of happiness was
hers. Her entering the
room was like a breath of
daffodils in spring. She
was a most beguiling creature.
It was a source of wonder and
congratulation to Papa Bouchard that
this charming girl did not succeed in
bamboozling all of her own income
out of him and all of his as well.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_062"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="She looked like one of those brilliant white
butterflies whose lives are spent dancing
in the sun"></div>

<p>Having kissed him, pinched his ear,
and otherwise agreeably maltreated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
her trustee, Léontine looked round the
new apartment with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,” she cried, laughing, “I see
how it is. You couldn’t stand the
Rue Clarisse another day or hour. Did
anybody ever tell you, Papa Bouchard,
that you had a vein of—a vein of—what
shall I call it?—a taste for the
wine of life in you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever did,” replied Papa
Bouchard, trying to be stern.</p>

<p>“Then I tell you so. And look at
these pictures—oh, oh!”</p>

<p>Léontine covered her face with her
chiffon scarf, to avoid the sight of the
young ladies pointing skyward with
their toes.</p>

<p>“And I wonder what Aunt Céleste
will say when she sees them,” continued
this impish Léontine.</p>

<p>“She won’t see them. They will
be removed to-morrow,” hastily put in
Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>“You’d better, you dear old thing,
if you value your life. I shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
tell Victor about this. How he will
laugh! I do all I can to make him
laugh and to amuse him when he is
with me, for it is <i>so</i> dull for him when
he is obliged to stay at Melun. When
his regimental duties are over he has
nothing to do in the evening but to
sit in his quarters and study up ballistics,
as he calls it, and look at my
picture by way of refreshment.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard sniffed. He commonly
sniffed at the mention of Captain
de Meneval’s name.</p>

<p>“But,” continued Léontine, trying
to curl Papa Bouchard’s scanty hair,
using her pretty fingers for curling
tongs, “he won’t be so lonely now at
Melun, for his old chum, Major Fallière,
is stationed there, too, and he and
Victor are like brothers. You know,
dear Papa Bouchard, that you yourself
admitted Major Fallière’s friendship to
be a letter of recommendation to any
man. He is called the Pink of Military
Propriety, and if Victor led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
larky life you so unjustly suspect him
of, he couldn’t be friends with Major
Fallière, who is positively straitlaced.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I ever saw a really
straitlaced major,” replied Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>“And I have not yet seen this dear
old P. M. P. He was in Algiers when
Victor and I were married—and he
has been so little in Paris since his return
that he has not yet had a chance
to call. But he has sent me word by
Victor that he already loves me, and I
hope to see him in a few days, for Victor
has promised to let me come out to
Melun and dine at the Pigeon House.”</p>

<p>“The Pigeon House!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not? You’ll be going
there yourself, I dare say, now that you
have eloped from Aunt Céleste. Oh,
you’ll be a desperate character in time,
I have no doubt. I see it in your eye.
Victor and I, though, shall keep watch
on you, if you go too far and too
fast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>This was a nice way for a ward to
talk to her trustee—and such a trustee
as Monsieur Bouchard! Therefore
Papa Bouchard called up his most
resolute air of disapproval, and said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid the Pigeon House is
hardly a proper place for you to go to,
Léontine.”</p>

<p>“If I thought that I should have
been out there long ago,” responded
this sprightly imp. “But, unluckily,
it’s perfectly proper.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” replied Papa Bouchard,
“you could get one single serious idea
into that head of yours.”</p>

<p>“I have a great many serious ideas,”
said Léontine, suddenly assuming an
unwonted air of gravity, and leaving
her perch on the arm of Papa Bouchard’s
chair for a seat directly facing
him. “What would you say if I told
you that I am taking a deep and real
interest in practical sociological questions,
such as giving employment to
the deserving workers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“I should say you were at least reaching
the development I have always
wished for you. But I hope you are
confining your experiments to giving
work only. The mere giving of money
tends to pauperize. The giving of
work is the intelligent mode of benefiting
a man or a woman.”</p>

<p>“That’s it precisely,” cried Léontine,
instantly losing her air of gravity, and
jumping up to kiss the bald spot on the
top of Papa Bouchard’s head. Then
she resumed her chair and her serious
manner simultaneously. “That’s what
I knew you’d say, dear Papa Bouchard.
I had your approval in mind all the
time. It came about in this way,” continued
Léontine, solemnly. “There
is a very worthy man—a Pole, Putzki
by name—who is one of the best
tailors in Paris. I became very much
interested in this man; likewise in his
jackets, coats and riding habits. I have
been to his shop several times and
talked with him. The man is an exile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
from his native country. How sad
that is! And he cannot go back. He
is very deserving and has a family to
support. He doesn’t ask for charity,
but I gave him——”</p>

<p>“All the money you had,” hastily and
angrily interjected Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Léontine, with
dignity. “I had learned better than
that. I have not given him a franc.
But I ordered, out of pure charity and
good will to a fellow creature, five
walking gowns, three jackets, two long
coats, a yachting costume and a couple
of riding habits.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard’s mouth opened wide,
but no sound came forth. Léontine,
taking advantage of his amazed silence,
kept on, rapidly:</p>

<p>“Then there is another deserving
case—Louise, a milliner and modiste.
She has a husband who squanders her
money on his pleasures. If Victor did
that I think it would kill me. Like
Putzki she does not ask money, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
work. Out of sympathy for her, I
have had her make me four ball gowns,
nine visiting and house costumes, some
little négligées and things, and about
eighteen hats. And here are the
bills.”</p>

<p>With this Léontine drew out two
huge bills and thrust them into Papa
Bouchard’s scowling face. Not only
was he annoyed with Léontine for her
extravagance, but he was conscious that
she had fooled him. He sat perfectly
still and silent, glaring into Léontine’s
serious, pretty countenance—not so
serious, though, but that Papa Bouchard
saw the shadow of a smile on her
rose-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>“And you expect to pay those bills
out of your allowance, I presume?”
said Papa Bouchard, sarcastically, after
a moment.</p>

<p>“You flatter me,” replied Léontine.
“I always knew I was a good financier,
but to expect me to pay such bills
as these out of my meagre allowance is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to credit me with the financial genius
of a Rothschild.”</p>

<p>“Then they will go unpaid!” cried
Papa Bouchard, determinedly. This
assault on him, following hard on
Captain de Meneval’s, was rather more
than he could stand. Léontine did
not know it, but the defeat Papa Bouchard
had just suffered at the hands of
that good-looking scapegrace, her husband,
had hardened his heart against
her and her milliner’s and tailor’s bills.
However, she was not easily frightened.
She only tapped her little foot, smiled
loftily and said:</p>

<p>“But they <i>must</i> be paid!”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, who had no more
voice than a crow, began to hum a
tune and to turn over the leaves of a
scientific journal that lay on the table
before him. A pause followed. Then
Léontine said again, very softly and
very determinedly:</p>

<p>“And they <i>will</i> be paid.”</p>

<p>“How, may I ask?” inquired Papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Bouchard, whirling round on her.
Léontine, throwing aside her chiffon
scarf, which she had held round her
bare, white neck, showed a string of
diamonds, as she thought them to be—paste,
Papa Bouchard knew them to be—and
said:</p>

<p>“My wedding gift from Victor. They
are worth forty thousand francs. I can
easily raise ten thousand on them.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard lay back in his chair,
absolutely stunned. So, both of them
were for turning the necklace into
cash! And what scandal would be
precipitated if Léontine carried out
her intention! The necklace would
be discovered to be paste, and Léontine
would naturally be deeply incensed
against her husband; Papa Bouchard
was that already, but he really loved
his little Léontine, and the thought of
trouble between her and her husband
disturbed him.</p>

<p>“Does Captain de Meneval know
of these bills?” he asked, significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Léontine hung her head. “No,”
she faltered, “and that is the part
which distresses me. Victor has been
so <i>very</i> prudent—has no bills, poor
fellow—he has no amusements away
from me—and I—I have been so selfish—”
Léontine’s eyes were bright
with tears.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_072">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="“Does Captain de Meneval know of these
bills?” he asked significantly">
</figure>

<p>“Don’t make yourself unhappy
about Victor being too prudent. He
need never give you any anxiety on
that point,” was Papa Bouchard’s unfeeling
reply.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Bouchard, who had a shrewd head for
business, was rapidly cogitating the best
thing co do under the circumstances.
Léontine, who had no head for business
at all, was wondering how she
could keep Victor from noticing the
absence of the necklace. She had just
concluded to fall into a state of great
weakness and prostration, thus preventing
her from going into society, when
she received something like a galvanic
shock, for there, before her eyes, Papa
Bouchard was holding up the exact
counterpart of her necklace. The two
necklaces made a blaze of light.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” she gasped,
pointing to the glittering thing in Papa
Bouchard’s hand.</p>

<p>Now, Papa Bouchard was a clever
man, as men are clever, but he was
not so clever as a woman. A brilliant
scheme had flashed into his mind—he
would produce the real necklace, tell
Léontine it was paste, and so make
sure that she would not take it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
pawnbroker; and he could manage both
de Meneval and Léontine equally well
with the paste necklace. He did not
much fancy having the responsibility
of so many diamonds as the real one
contained. But he had not foreseen
this direct and embarrassing question of
Léontine’s. He looked blank for a
moment or two, and then, having no
better answer ready, replied testily:</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t ask such questions,
Léontine. Of course I came
by it honestly.”</p>

<p>“Of course—of course,” cried Léontine,
jumping up. “Does Aunt Céleste
know of this?”</p>

<p>“N—n—no,” faltered Papa Bouchard.
This was another facer for
him.</p>

<p>Léontine had not the slightest doubt
that Papa Bouchard could give a perfectly
rational and correct account of
how he came by the necklace—it was
probably the property of some client—but
seeing a fine chance to hold Papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Bouchard up to obloquy and to lecture
him, she promptly determined to give
him the benefit of her pretended suspicions.
She therefore rose with great
dignity, gathered her drapery about her,
and looking significantly at Papa Bouchard,
said:</p>

<p>“You will pardon me for saying that
this has a most singular appearance,
and I shall lose no time in informing
Aunt Céleste.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard turned pale. Was
ever such a diabolical trap laid for an
innocent man? He was not at all
sure, if he gave the true account of
how he came by the stones, that Captain
de Meneval would not carry out
his threat and deny the whole business.
The fellow had actually laughed while
he was making the threat, and seemed
to regard it as an excellent joke to impair
the peace and honor of a respectable
elderly gentleman. Papa Bouchard
got up, sat down again, and groaned.</p>

<p>“Léontine,” he said, to that professedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
indignant young woman, “you
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“No, I <i>don’t</i> understand,” replied
Léontine, with unkind emphasis.</p>

<p>“It was this way—I was out at St.
Germains the other day—” Papa
Bouchard was floundering hopelessly,
but a bright thought struck him—“the
day of the meeting of the Society
of French Antiquarians. Very interesting
time we had—several specimens
of the paleozoic age were found——”</p>

<p>“And this match to my necklace
was among them? Fie, Papa Bouchard!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Will you let me
speak? I say I was out at St. Germains
for the meeting of the Society of
French Antiquarians. The curator of
the museum is a great friend of mine—he
has an old mother—finest old lady
you ever saw—eighty years old, bedridden
and stone blind, but as young as
a daisy, full of life and talk—it’s a
treat to see her. My friend wanted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
birthday present for her, and I had seen
this necklace in a shop window in the
Avenue de l’Opéra—and I proposed
to—to—to—” Papa Bouchard faltered.</p>

<p>“Buy it for an old lady, eighty years
old and bedridden? Oh, Papa Bouchard,
try again!”</p>

<p>“Léontine,” said Papa Bouchard,
sternly, “I don’t like these flippant interruptions.
I did not say—I never
meant to say that I proposed to buy
a diamond necklace for an old lady,
bedridden and eighty years of age.
It happened there were spectacles
of all kinds made and kept at the
same shop—and I went and got a
pair of Scotch pebble glasses, at fifty
francs——”</p>

<p>“But you said she was stone
blind?”</p>

<p>“What if I did? I didn’t say I
got the glasses for her. But as I see
you won’t let me tell you the story of
the necklace, I shall simply keep it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
myself. As a matter of fact, they are
not diamonds, they are paste.”</p>

<p>Léontine, taking the real stones in
her hand, examined them carefully.
Then, laying them against the necklace
around her own milk-white throat, she
remarked: “I see they are. Paste, pure
and simple.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard could hardly suppress
a smile at this, but he did.</p>

<p>“Very well. They are paste, and
they cost seventy-five francs. Now, I
will make you a proposition. I propose
that I shall look into these bills
and see what arrangement can be made
with Putzki and Louise, and reach
some basis of settlement whereby I
may be able, by making a series of
small payments out of your income, to
get rid of them. Meanwhile, I am
afraid to trust you with your own
necklace—you will always be trying
to raise money on it. So I shall hand
you over this paste one, which no one
but a jeweller can tell from the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
one. You will give me the real one—and
I will hold it until your bills
are paid. Then I will return it to
you. I suppose you don’t wish your
husband to know of this, and I will
agree to keep it from him as long as
you keep out of debt. But if you ever
transgress in this way again I shall tell
him the whole story.”</p>

<p>Léontine listened to this with the
utmost gravity, and then replied:
“You are a very clever man, Papa
Bouchard, but you will find your little
Léontine a very clever woman—too
clever to put her head in the noose
you have so kindly held open for her.
I sha’n’t dream of giving up my necklace
for anything less than a cheque
out of my own money for the payment
in full of these bills. I should be willing
to take the paste necklace temporarily
until the bills are paid. After
you have returned it to me I sha’n’t
be in the least afraid of your telling
Victor, for if you do I shall tell Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Céleste all your tales about the bedridden
old lady and the trip to St. Germains
and the widow——”</p>

<p>“What widow?” asked Papa Bouchard,
forgetful for a moment of the
lady he had met in the railway carriage
two days in succession.</p>

<p>“The prim little widow you went
to Verneuil with. My maid happened
to be on the same train and saw you
helping her out, and heard you say to
her you were going to St. Germains to-day—and
by the way, I happen to know
you <i>did</i> go to St. Germains to-day.”</p>

<p>What a story was this to hatch about
the most correct old gentleman in
Paris! Papa Bouchard simply glared
at Léontine, but that merry young
woman was smiling and dimpling, as if
debts and duns and trips to Verneuil
and diamond necklaces were quite the
ordinary ingredients of life. The hen
that hatched a cockatrice was no more
puzzled and dismayed than was Papa
Bouchard at the vagaries of his ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Well,” cried he, after a pause, determined
to put a bold front on the
matter, “what if I did find a lady in
the same railway carriage with me,
going to Verneuil? I hadn’t hired
the whole train, or even a whole carriage.
And what if she was a widow,
and good-looking! And suppose to-day,
in the pursuit of science, I go to
St. Germains and quite by accident I
find the same lady in the compartment
with me? What does that mean except
a series of accidents?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a series of accidents,” replied
Léontine, with an arch glance. The
minx seemed to have no more conscience
about teasing poor Papa Bouchard
than had her rattlebrain of a
husband. “It is remarkable that accidents
like these always happen in
cycles. I should be willing to wager
that a third accident is now brewing,
and you will see that prim little widow
again before the week is out. I
shouldn’t be surprised if this change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of quarters had something to do with
it!”</p>

<p>“Léontine!” said Papa Bouchard,
indignantly, but that heedless young
person only laughed and said:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Victor that. How the
dear boy will laugh! The fact is, I
don’t know whether I can let Victor
associate with you or not—you might
lead him off into your own primrose
path of dalliance with widows!”</p>

<p>Was ever anything so exasperating!
Papa Bouchard ground his teeth—he
had a great mind to throw over the
whole business of Léontine’s money and
her affairs, only he knew it would please
her too well. His grim meditations
were interrupted by Léontine tapping
him on the shoulder and saying, “Now,
will you hand me over the cheque for
the whole amount of those bills—six
thousand francs—or must I take this”—touching
the paste necklace round
her throat—“to the pawnbroker?”</p>

<p>“You certainly can’t expect me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
give you a cheque until I have looked
into these swindling bills,” answered
Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” tartly said Léontine,
“and you will either hand me
over immediately a cheque for six thousand
francs, or I will drive to Aunt
Céleste’s before I go to the opera—and
I think you’ll have an early visit from
her in the morning. I shall tell her
about this mysterious necklace, and
the pretty widow you have no doubt
been running after for at least six
months——”</p>

<p>“I never saw her in my life until
yesterday,” cried Monsieur Bouchard.</p>

<p>“So you say. Perhaps you have
been pursuing her for a year.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard tore his hair, but
there was no help for him. After an
angry pause, he sat down, wrote out
a cheque for six thousand francs, which
he slammed down on the table, and
Léontine picked up with a joyful cry.
And then, with a desperate attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
at an authoritative manner, he said,
sternly,</p>

<p>“Pray understand, Léontine, that I
reserve the right to tell your husband
all the circumstances of this affair if I
choose to. I am not intimidated by
your threat to tell my sister some cock-and-bull
story about <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Léontine reflected a moment, her
pretty head on her hand.</p>

<p>“Do you know, dear Papa Bouchard,”
she said, after a while, “that
you and I are engaged in what the
Americans call a game of bluff?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know anything about the
Americans. Don’t know what bluff is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do—you know the
thing, although you may not recognize
the name. But you are a good soul,
Papa Bouchard, and Victor and I <i>do</i>
bother you a good deal; but only say
no more of this matter—about Putzki
and Louise—and don’t tell Victor, and
I’ll not tell Aunt Céleste, and everything
will come perfectly right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>As Léontine spoke she unclasped her
necklace, kissed it, and with a gesture
of scorn put on the real necklace, saying
to herself: “I never thought I
should come to this.”</p>

<p>And then came a loud rat-tat at the
door, and in walked Captain de Meneval
again. He carried Monsieur Bouchard’s
impedimenta, with which he
had so unceremoniously made off. Both
he and Léontine looked thoroughly disconcerted
at meeting each other. De
Meneval thought she had gone away.
Léontine blushed guiltily, and had
barely enough presence of mind to
cover up the necklace lying on the
table with Papa Bouchard’s scientific
journal.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-evening, Papa Bouchard!”
cried this arch hypocrite of an artillery
captain, as if he had not seen Monsieur
Bouchard half an hour before. “I
came to return your umbrella and coat.
Thanks very much for lending them to
me in an emergency. Why, little girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
I thought you were on your way to the
opera?”</p>

<p>“I am just going,” answered Léontine,
moving toward the door.</p>

<p>“One moment!” cried Papa Bouchard,
waving his arm authoritatively.
These two scapegraces had used him
for their own purposes that night, had
made game of him, and had threatened
to discover a mare’s nest to Mademoiselle
Bouchard and had got seven thousand
francs out of him in cold cash.
Now, however, he would take his
revenge. “Wait,” he said to Léontine,
who returned reluctantly to her
former place.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard, assuming the
attitude and tone with which he addressed
a couple of criminals in the
pursuit of his professional duties, then
continued:</p>

<p>“This is a very auspicious opportunity
for me to speak to you both, in
each other’s presence, with a view to
your mutual reform. Observe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
word; I use it advisedly.” He paused.
Léontine trembled with apprehension,
while de Meneval surreptitiously mopped
his brow. “You have both of you
been very extravagant—wasteful, I
may say. Nothing that I have yet
said has availed to stop the outgo
of money far beyond your reasonable
wants—so <i>I</i> think. Now, I have
come to the conclusion that in order
for you to economize you must give
up your apartment. You must leave
Paris.”</p>

<p>Leave Paris!</p>

<p>De Meneval was not so stunned but
that he could get up rather a ghastly
laugh.</p>

<p>“Leave Paris! Ha, ha! That’s
little enough to me, Papa Bouchard—Léontine
and ballistics are all I want
to make me happy anywhere—but
Léontine—oh, I know she won’t
go!”</p>

<p>“Won’t she, eh? Not to an inexpensive
little cottage outside of Paris—within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
striking distance of Melun,
so you may go back and forth—a <i>very</i>
inexpensive cottage?”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s your game,” cried
de Meneval, savagely, “there are
plenty of cottages to be had at Melun.
Our veterinarian has just given up his
cottage—three rooms and a dog kennel.
That’s cheap enough. Shall I
take it to-morrow for Captain and
Madame de Meneval?”</p>

<p>“You are trifling, Monsieur le Capitaine,”
coolly answered Papa Bouchard.
“You understand perfectly
well what I mean.”</p>

<p>“But, Papa Bouchard,” put in Léontine,
faintly, “while <i>I</i> don’t object to
the cottage, it would be cruel to Victor
to force him away from Paris. It is
so dull, anyway, at Melun. The only
recreation he has is when he comes to
Paris. Poor, poor Victor!”</p>

<p>Léontine was almost weeping—de
Meneval was swearing between his
teeth. Papa Bouchard was waving his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
arm about, serene in the consciousness
of power.</p>

<p>“I do not say you are to leave
Paris to-night, or even to-morrow;
perhaps a week—possibly a month—may
be given you. But you are both
too fond of gaieties, of clothes, of
suppers and other dissipated things,
and there are too many jewellers’ shops
in Paris.” This thrust caused both of
the culprits to quake. “So you must
go to some retired place and economize.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied de Meneval, who
was thoroughly exasperated. “Having
yourself practically run away from a
quiet and respectable locality to these
gay quarters, with young ladies of the
ballet on every hand—” de Meneval
pointed angrily to the red-and-gold
young ladies on the walls—“now you
wish to send my poor little wife off to
some hole of a village, where one may
exist but not live. I don’t speak of
myself—<i>I</i> don’t care. It’s for her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Very well,” answered Papa Bouchard,
maliciously. “You may make
that hole of a village a paradise steeped
in dreamlike splendor to Léontine by
your devoted and lover-like attentions
to her. You can live over your honeymoon.
Won’t you like that, Léontine?”</p>

<p>“Y—yes,” replied Léontine, dolefully.</p>

<p>“Some pretty rural place—all birds
and flowers, eh? And a little dog.
Doesn’t the prospect charm you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—only—for Victor——”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you just heard Victor say
that all he needs to be perfectly happy
are you and ballistics? So I suppose,
Monsieur de Meneval, you will be revelling
in rapture.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied de Meneval,
gloomily. “Come, Léontine, shall I
put you in the carriage? You won’t
have many chances of going to the
opera, poor child, after this.”</p>

<p>Léontine rose and said, coldly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
“Good-night, Papa Bouchard.” There
was no tweaking of his ear, no patting
of his bald head this time. They went
out like two sulky and disappointed
children.</p>

<img class="w100" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="They went out like two sulky and disappointed

</figure>

<p>Papa Bouchard remained chuckling
to himself. He had those two naughty
young creatures in the hollow of his
hand—it would be a good while before
they would dare to be saucy to him—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
that little cottage in the suburbs
was a fine idea. Strange it had not
occurred to him before.</p>

<p>He seated himself in his easychair
and began to review the events of his
first day of liberty. His mind went
back to the point where he had been
interrupted by de Meneval’s entrance—the
point where the dear little bashful
widow had appeared in his mind’s
eye. If he had been in the Rue Clarisse
he would never even have dared
to think of Madame Vernet, for his
sister could actually read his thoughts.
But here, in this jolly bachelor place,
he could think about widows all he
liked. And shutting his eyes the better
to recall that slim, shrinking, gray-gowned
figure, he opened them to see
Madame Vernet quietly walking into
the room, without knocking and quite
as if she belonged there. She advanced
to the table on one side of the room,
laid her lace parasol on it and proceeded
to remove her long gloves, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
stopped in the midst of the process to
rearrange a chair and to set straight a
picture—one of Monsieur Bouchard’s.</p>

<p>“This is very comfortable,” she said,
musingly, “but I can improve it—when
I am settled here.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard listened as if in a
dream. He had not progressed so far
as that. And then Madame Vernet
turning and seeing him, uttered a faint
shriek, as if she had seen a snake instead
of a human being, and ran—but
not toward the door.</p>

<p>“My dear Madame Vernet, pray do
not be alarmed. It is only I—Monsieur
Bouchard,” cried Papa Bouchard,
striving to reassure her.</p>

<p>“Oh! is it you? Forgive me for
being so agitated, but I am <i>so</i> easily
frightened!” panted Madame Vernet.
“Men always frighten me—I am the
most timid woman in the world!”</p>

<p>“So I see,” tenderly replied Papa
Bouchard. He was standing quite close
to Madame Vernet now, and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
clasped his arm and looked nervously
about her, as if she expected another
man to spring out of the fireplace or
down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“But when I saw it was only you,
all my fears vanished,” she continued.
“And will you tell me to what I am
indebted for the honor and pleasure of
this visit?”</p>

<p>“A question I was just asking myself.
This is my new apartment.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon,” replied Madame
Vernet, “but it is <i>my</i> new apartment.
I only moved into it to-day.”</p>

<p>“And, Madame, I only moved into
it to-day.”</p>

<p>“It is number nine, fourth floor.”</p>

<p>“No, Madame, it is number five,
third floor.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried Madame Vernet. “I
see. My apartment is directly over
this, and corresponds with it exactly.
I did not go up high enough, and I am
not quite familiar with the surroundings.
How absurd!” and she laughed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
showing the prettiest teeth in the
world.</p>

<p>“How delightful!” replied Monsieur
Bouchard, gallantly.</p>

<p>“And how singular! This is the
third time in three days we have met
by accident.”</p>

<p>An uncomfortable recollection of
Léontine’s speech about accidents of
this sort occurring in cycles flashed
through Monsieur Bouchard’s brain,
but he dismissed the thought with
energy. He rather relished accidents
that brought about meetings with a
woman as winning, as charming, as
elegant as Madame Vernet; and then
there was that deliciously intoxicating
feeling of independence—no need to
cut the interview short, no labored explanation
to give Mademoiselle Céleste.
Monsieur Bouchard was his own man
now—for the first time, at fifty-four
years of age. So he smiled benevolently,
and said:</p>

<p>“I wish I might ask you to sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
down, but at least you will grant me
permission to call on you.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” replied Madame
Vernet. “And since you won’t let me
sit down—which, of course, wouldn’t
be proper, and I wouldn’t commit the
smallest impropriety for a million francs—at
least let me walk about and look
at your charming furnishings.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard made a heartfelt
apology for the red-and-gold young
ladies on the walls, who evidently
shocked Madame Vernet extremely.
He said he meant to take them down
the next day. Madame Vernet replied
with gentle severity that he ought to
take them down that night. However,
she went into raptures over “Kittens
at Play” and “Socrates and His Pupils,”
which gave Papa Bouchard a high idea
of her intellectuality.</p>

<p>But in the midst of a learned dissertation
on “The Coliseum by Moonlight”
Madame Vernet’s eyes fell on
the glittering paste necklace, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Monsieur Bouchard had left lying on
the table. She picked it up gently—she
did everything gently—and playfully
clasping it round her neck, cried:</p>

<p>“How charming! I won’t ask you
for whom this is intended; for a sister—a
niece, perhaps. Lucky girl!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is not intended for anyone,”
replied Monsieur Bouchard. “It
is of trifling value—paste, at seventy-five
francs to buy, and would sell for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it is very pretty,”
said Madame Vernet, looking at herself
coquettishly in the mirror. And then,
apparently forgetting all about the necklace,
she confided to Monsieur Bouchard
that she was so nervous at living
alone—the only thing that reconciled
her was that she had an uncle and an
aunt living in the neighborhood who
would watch over her. Monsieur Bouchard
tried to reassure her, but Madame
Vernet declined to be reassured. Her
timidity was constitutional—she should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
never be courageous as other women,
and so protesting, she gathered up her
parasol and gloves, and with blushing
apologies for her intrusion and a bashful
invitation to Monsieur Bouchard to
return her unique visit, made for the
door.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_098">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="Monsieur Bouchard tried to reassure her—her
timidity was constitutional">
</figure>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard was charmed,
flattered, tickled and flustered beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
expression, but he was likewise terrified
at the thought that Madame Vernet had
evidently forgotten that she had the
necklace clasped round her throat and
was going off with it. Paste though it
was, Monsieur Bouchard had no mind
to let it go out of his own hands.
He followed her to the door, saying,
“Madame, you have probably forgotten——”</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_100"><img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="Monsieur Bouchard sank or rather fell
into a chair"></div>

<p>“Oh, no, I haven’t,” smilingly replied
Madame Vernet; “I know my
own apartment now—it is number
nine.”</p>

<p>“But—but—you have inadvertently—er—a—”
Poor Monsieur Bouchard
mopped his forehead in his
agony.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite inadvertently entered
your apartment. Oh, how alarmed I
was when I first saw you! But you
were so kind. Forgive me, and don’t
forget your promise to call. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>And just as Monsieur Bouchard had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
made up his mind to ask for the necklace
she flitted out of the door.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard sank, or rather
fell, into a chair. His head was in a
whirl. He felt as if the
events of that day were
beginning to be a little
too much for him. Just
at that moment Pierre appeared
from no one could
exactly say where.</p>

<p>“Come, now,” said that
functionary, in a tone of
what Monsieur Bouchard
would have thought brazen familiarity
the day before, “I know all about it,
I saw the whole transaction; remember,
Monsieur, we are pals now. She
can’t get money on it any more than
Madame de Meneval can, and she’ll
be sure to turn up again. Oh, you’ll
come out all right, Monsieur. Cheer
up. We’ll live a merry life, and
after all, it is something to be away
from that dreary old hole in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Rue Clarisse. Just listen, if you
please.”</p>

<p>Pierre ran to the window, threw it
wide open, and the strains of rag time
music from the music halls filled the
room.</p>

<p>“Everything goes in rag time at this
jolly place,” cried Pierre—and then
that staid, sober and decorous valet of
thirty years’ service, cut the pigeon
wing, twirled around on one leg, with
the other stuck stiffly out like a ballet
dancer’s, and kissing his hand in the
direction of Madame Vernet’s apartment,
cried, “Oh, we’re a gay pair of
boys! We mean to see life! And no
peaching on each other!” And with
ineffable impudence, he winked at
Monsieur Bouchard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MONSIEUR BOUCHARD
waked next morning with a
delicious sense of youth and irresponsibility.
There was no one to demand
an account of him for anything. As
for Pierre, Monsieur Bouchard determined
to treat his vagaries in a jocular
manner—it was simply the honest
fellow’s way of showing joy at his
emancipation. And when Pierre appeared,
to shave his master, both of
them wore a cheerful air. It was their
14th of July.</p>

<p>Pierre, at the same time he brought
the hot water, brought Monsieur Bouchard’s
letters. What a comfort to
read them without having to give an
explanation of every one to Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Céleste! Monsieur Bouchard
actually enjoyed receiving his tailor’s
bill for the half-year under those circumstances.
As for Pierre, he went
about whistling like a whole flock of
blackbirds, and Monsieur Bouchard had
not the heart or the inclination to stop
him. The only fly in Monsieur Bouchard’s
ointment was the unpleasant
reflection that Madame Vernet still had
the paste necklace, but he felt sure that
she had discovered her inadvertence of
the night before, and would return the
thing during the day.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Pierre, who seemed
to have quite taken the direction of
Monsieur Bouchard’s affairs, “that
Monsieur will be looking after the bills
of Captain and Madame de Meneval
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall,” replied Monsieur
Bouchard.</p>

<p>“And, Monsieur, you will find it
necessary to go out to the Pigeon
House at Melun to settle up Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
le Capitaine’s account without Madame
finding it out?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Monsieur
Bouchard. “It is a nuisance; I never
was at Melun in my life.”</p>

<p>“But that’s no reason why Monsieur
never should go to Melun; and
I’ve been told that the Pigeon House is
a very gay place, with excellent wine.
Suppose Monsieur makes an evening
of it out there?”</p>

<p>“Pierre,” said Monsieur Bouchard,
wheeling around on him, “are you
trying to get me into all sorts of indiscretions
in order to report me to the
Rue Clarisse?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no, sir!” replied Pierre,
with much readiness. “I am going
to the Moulin Rouge myself to-night,
and I’m sure if my wife knew it she
would take not only my hair, but my
scalp with it, off my head. The
Moulin Rouge is a harmless enough
place, but that’s what’s been the matter
with our bringing up, Monsieur—we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
weren’t allowed to go to harmless
places even. For my part, I mean to
have my fling, even if my wife <i>does</i> find
it out, and disciplines me. But there’s
no reason for either one of us being
found out if we’ll only agree to stand
by each other.”</p>

<p>This was very satisfactory; in fact,
everything seemed to be coming Monsieur
Bouchard’s way except—the
paste necklace. The thought of that,
like the ghost at Lady Macbeth’s tea
party, would not down. Monsieur
Bouchard waited and lingered and dallied
over his breakfast, and yet no parcel
came from Madame Vernet. He did
not care to remain at home all day
waiting for it; no doubt it would come.
It occurred to him that the best plan
was to take Pierre completely into his
confidence. It was true the rascal
knew something of what had happened
the night before, but Monsieur Bouchard
felt it necessary, in Pierre’s new
rôle of trusty henchman and prime minister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
to confide all the particulars to
him. However, this must be done
in a manner consistent with the relations
of master and man. So, when
Pierre was handing him his coat, hat
and gloves, preparatory to going out,
Monsieur Bouchard remarked, quite
casually, as if Pierre knew nothing of
the happenings of the night before:</p>

<p>“By the way, I am expecting a little
parcel to be sent me by Madame Vernet,
the lady on the next floor, a very
pretty little woman—a widow——”</p>

<p>“Trust Monsieur for finding out all
the pretty little widows between here
and the Rue Clarisse,” replied Pierre,
with the impudent grin that had scarce
left his face since he established himself
in the Rue Bassano.</p>

<p>Now, this remark was not only
grossly familiar but grotesquely untrue,
so Monsieur Bouchard frowned and
said, sternly:</p>

<p>“You forget yourself.”</p>

<p>“And all the pretty little widows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
will have an eye on Monsieur,” replied
this unabashed reprobate of a
Pierre.</p>

<p>At this Monsieur Bouchard wished
to frown, but could not. Instead,
his mouth came open in a pleased
grin.</p>

<p>“Well, well, that may or may not
be true. At all events, last night Madame
Vernet, by the merest accident,
came into this apartment, mistaking it
for her own.” Monsieur Bouchard
paused. It was rather a difficult story
to tell.</p>

<p>“By accident, did you say, Monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Altogether by accident. A paste
necklace belonging to Madame de
Meneval was lying on my table, and
Madame Vernet inadvertently carried
it off. She will no doubt return it
this morning. Take care of it when
it comes.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir, if it comes. But Monsieur
will pardon me if I say I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
expect it to come—that is, if I know
anything about women.”</p>

<p>“But you <i>don’t</i> know anything about
women,” curtly replied Monsieur Bouchard.
Pierre was getting quite beside
himself.</p>

<p>“True, Monsieur. I have been
married thirty years. That is enough to
convince the toughest sceptic who ever
lived that he doesn’t know anything
about women. But, all the same,
Madame Vernet isn’t going to send
that necklace back.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard turned pale and
took an agitated turn about the room.</p>

<p>“Did Monsieur buy the paste necklace
for—for—Mademoiselle Bouchard?”
asked Pierre.</p>

<p>“No, you idiot! Didn’t I tell you
it belongs to Madame de Meneval—no—to
Captain de Meneval—oh, the
devil!”</p>

<p>Such expletives as this had been
strictly forbidden in the Rue Clarisse,
and in spite of his annoyance Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Bouchard felt a sense of pleasure in
being able to call on the devil in a
casual and informal manner.</p>

<p>“I understand, Monsieur,” replied
Pierre, with the wink that, like the
grin, appeared to have become constitutional
with him since his advent in
the Rue Bassano. “The accidental
Madame Vernet appears to have become
accidentally possessed of a paste
necklace that is not hers. Accidents
will happen; but one accident that I
am sure will not occur is the return of
the necklace.”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” roared Monsieur
Bouchard. He felt a delicious relish
in saying this profane word. It was
the first time in his life he had ever
used it.</p>

<p>“Very well, Monsieur. Damnation
or no damnation, I will keep the necklace
for you—if I get it.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard dashed down
the stairs faster than he had ever done
in his life before. But on reaching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
street and adopting a decorous pace, he
thought, “Of course it’s nonsense to
suppose that she won’t return it. The
fact is, I have got to discipline that
Pierre. He has altogether forgotten
himself, and I shall have to teach him
a few lessons.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the gay little apartment
in the Avenue de l’Impératrice,
where the de Meneval <i>ménage</i> was
situated, the necklace had become a
haunting ghost as well as in the Rue
Bassano.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_111">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="As Léontine and her husband sat opposite
each other—each felt like a
criminal">
</figure>

<p>As Léontine and her husband sat
opposite each other at breakfast in the
pretty little <i>salle à manger</i>, each felt
like a criminal. It was a very pretty
little <i>salle à manger</i>—just the sort of
room for a young couple with a modest
income, yet sufficient to live on. But
there is not a young couple in existence
who, knowing that their income
is cut exactly in half while the other
half is saved up for them, would be
satisfied with their moiety. This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
however, was bliss compared to the
prospect of that dreary little cottage in
the country to which Papa Bouchard
had condemned them—or rather, to
which they had condemned each other—for
each thought secretly that but
for those unlucky debts and the diamond
necklace, Papa Bouchard would
never have been so hard on them.
The most painful part of it was, however,
the necessity of concealment each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
felt toward the other. They had, up
to this time, lived their married life
with the perfect frankness of two devoted
young persons who love and
confide in each other—and this was
what it had come to—bitterly thought
de Meneval, who truly loved his pretty
little wife—her diamonds practically
put in pawn by him with that old curmudgeon,
who had got thereby just the
opportunity he wanted to exile them
from Paris. All these thoughts chased
through his mind as he looked at Léontine
with a new and unpleasant conviction
that he was a villain.</p>

<p>Léontine, for her part, felt a horrid
heart-sickness when she remembered
the paste necklace quietly reposing in
the strong-box in her dressing-room,
while Victor’s wedding gift was in
Papa Bouchard’s strong-box in the Rue
Bassano. And that dull little house in
the country! It was she who had
brought all this on Victor, and the
thought filled her heart with remorseful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
tenderness toward her husband.
She addressed him by the fondest
names as she poured his coffee for him.</p>

<p>“And you have to go to that tiresome
Melun to-day, to be away from
me two whole days?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied de Meneval. “How
I wish you could go with me! I have
often been sorry I gave up my quarters
to accommodate Lefebvre, with his
wife and four children to support on
her <i>dot</i> and his captain’s pay. I didn’t
mind living <i>en garçon</i> until I had a wife
of my own.”</p>

<p>It was quite true that de Meneval,
out of generosity, had given up the best
part of his quarters to his brother officer,
and had not the heart to ask for
them again, especially as he was generally
supposed to be in the enjoyment
of a large income.</p>

<p>“Don’t say you are sorry, Victor.
For my part, charming as it would be
to stay at Melun with you, I am glad
you can help the poor Lefebvres. <i>We</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
know what it is to want money, don’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we do.”</p>

<p>“And our case is the harder that no
one will believe we haven’t the use of
our money.”</p>

<p>Léontine, who was delicate-minded,
always called her money “our money,”
and de Meneval deeply and affectionately
appreciated this.</p>

<p>“And it will be duller than ever at
that odious little cottage in the suburbs
of Melun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Léontine, I am afraid it
is I who have brought this on you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no—it is I, or rather
Papa Bouchard’s old-fashioned, stingy
ideas. He has no notion of what a
modern way of living costs.”</p>

<p>“But he will find out in the Rue
Bassano, if I’m not mistaken,” said de
Meneval, laughing suddenly.</p>

<p>Then there was a long pause, broken
by Léontine’s throwing down her napkin
and crying out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“I have an inspiration! We are so
dull and disheartened to-day that nothing
but a supper at the Pigeon House
will cheer us up. You will take me
there to-night. Remember, you promised
me.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” asked poor de Meneval.
He was, in truth, afraid to show his
face at the Pigeon House lest the head
waiter should quietly tap him on the
shoulder and ask him to step up to the
bureau and pay the whole of the nineteen
hundred francs. And what would
become of that story he had told Léontine
about never having set foot in the
Pigeon House since his marriage?
Only the week before, there had been
a little supper—de Meneval’s recollection
of it was rather cloudy—but
he thought he remembered something
about going to sleep on a bench, and
waking up and finding an umbrella in
his sword-belt instead of his sword.
This scheme of Léontine’s was most
unlucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“And I must and will go this very
evening!” cried Léontine, jumping up
and running around to her husband’s
chair, where she proceeded to perch
herself on the arm. “I know exactly
how it can be done. I will take the
eight o’clock train. You will meet me
at the station. We will go to the
Pigeon House, where you will secure
a table in that charming terrace garden
you have told me so much about.
We will have a jolly little supper—and
I’ll pay for the champagne. No—no!”
putting her hands over de
Meneval’s mouth. “And it will be
such fun to watch the queer people
passing in and out of the music hall!”</p>

<p>“Some of them,” said de Meneval,
with the hope of frightening Léontine,
“are very queer indeed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know. You have often
told me about the singers and dancers
coming out there in their theatre
clothes, and that’s just what I want to
see. And as for any impropriety—haven’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
I often heard you say that every
one of those hard-working ballet girls
is supporting her bedridden parents, or
crippled husband, or something of the
sort?”</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> say that many of them are
honest and hard-working.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it! The mere fact
that they work is enough. You know
I have been studying sociology of late,
and I know something about the working
people.” Léontine, as she said
this, had an uncomfortable twinge
when she remembered Putzki and
Louise.</p>

<p>Now, if anything in the world was
calculated to make the bright June
morning blacker than it was already to
de Meneval, it was this sudden freak
of Léontine’s to go out to the Pigeon
House to supper. He fidgeted in his
chair, and hummed and ha’d, but Léontine
prattled on, talking about the
amusement she should have.</p>

<p>“And I shall at last meet Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Fallière! I am so anxious to know
him, the dear old thing!”</p>

<p>“Fallière won’t be at Melun to-night.
He goes to Châlons on special
duty to-day,” cried de Meneval, seeing
a gleam of hope. “Why not wait
until he comes back—some time next
week?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is quite useless waiting for
an officer. He may be snatched up at
any time and packed off to the ends of
the earth. And go to the Pigeon House
to-night I shall, I will, I must—” she
punctuated this sentence by giving de
Meneval three charming kisses—“and
if it’s very improper, so much the better!
I shall go to the Rue Clarisse
and tell Aunt Céleste you forced me to
go against my will, and so escape a
scolding.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” replied poor
de Meneval, “but how will you get
back to-night? I can’t leave—and
I don’t know of anyone returning to
Paris.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Don’t bother your head about that.
You will put me on the train at Melun—my
maid will meet me at the St.
Lazare station. What could be simpler?
No, no, no! I shall sup with
you to-night at the Pigeon House, so
be sure and meet me at the station at
half-past eight o’clock—you have just
time to make your train.” And she
flew into his room, brought out his
helmet and sword—for he was in uniform,
being ready to report for duty—and
kissing him affectionately, pushed
him out of the door. De Meneval ran
down the stairs and, jumping into a
cab, drove rapidly off. He waved his
hand to Léontine, watching him from
the balcony.</p>

<p>Deceits and concealments were a
new burden for Léontine to carry, and
she spent a wretched day. Do what
she would, she saw her diamond necklace
at every turn. It haunted her as
the dagger haunted the Scotch lady in
the play. Still woebegone, she determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to go to see Aunt Céleste in the
Rue Clarisse. What a dismal old
street it was, anyhow! Dark and dull
and utterly without life—no wonder
Papa Bouchard had tired of it and had
levanted into a gayer precinct. When
she was ushered into Mademoiselle
Bouchard’s dingy little drawing-room
she found that good woman, Aunt
Céleste, seated with one eye on her
embroidery and the other on Élise,
who was polishing up the already shining
furniture. Aunt Céleste’s usually
placid face was troubled, but it lighted
up when she saw Léontine running in.
Aunt Céleste was genuinely fond of the
girl, albeit she was in chronic spasms
over Léontine’s modern, and to poor
Mademoiselle Céleste’s notion, outlandish
ideas. Still, they really loved each
other, and kissed affectionately.</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Céleste, how do you
stand Papa Bouchard’s absence?” asked
Léontine, jokingly, but not unkindly.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard wagged her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
head disconsolately. “It is not how
I stand it. It is how he, poor, dear
boy, stands it. Who will look after
his dinner and see that he has simple
and wholesome food? Who will look
to his flannels? Who will see that he
lays aside his books at ten o’clock and
goes to bed, as he has always been accustomed?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_121">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="Still, they really loved each other, and
kissed affectionately">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“It seems to me, Aunt Céleste, that
as Papa Bouchard is fifty-four years of
age he ought to know something about
taking care of himself.”</p>

<p>“But he doesn’t. However, I have
given him Pierre. I have the greatest
confidence in Pierre. In thirty years
I have never known him to be guilty
of an indiscretion. He was very unwilling
to go, poor fellow. He is truly
attached to the quiet and decorum of
the Rue Clarisse, and objected very
much to the noise and bustle of the
Rue Bassano, with so many theatres
about and people turning night into day.
I almost had to force him to go—but
I did it on my poor, dear brother’s account.
Pierre is to come to see me
every day to tell me just how the dear
boy has passed his time.”</p>

<p>Léontine sincerely hoped that Pierre
would not think it necessary to mention
her visit to Papa Bouchard the
night before.</p>

<p>“And I have had another sorrow,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
continued poor Mademoiselle Bouchard.
“My parrot—Pierrot—that I have
had for seventeen years, and taught so
many moral and useful aphorisms—he,
too, has deserted me.”</p>

<p>“All three of them vanished—like
this—<i>pouf!</i>” Élise put in, with the
freedom of an old servant. “Monsieur
Bouchard, that good-for-nothing
husband of mine and Pierrot—and all
bent on mischief—that I’ll swear to!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard proceeded to
read Élise a lecture on the duties of the
married state, among the first of which
was the obligation of the wife to believe
everything her husband tells her,
at which Élise laughed grimly.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is joking, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Although Mademoiselle Bouchard led
so retired a life, she liked well enough
to know what was going on in the outside
world, if only to be shocked at it.
So, when Léontine told her about the
proposed supper at the Pigeon House
that evening, Mademoiselle Bouchard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
was duly horrified, terrified and mortified,
but she did not forget to charge
Léontine to come and tell her all the
dreadful things she saw at that unconventional
place.</p>

<p>Léontine, after spending the morning
in the Rue Clarisse, returned to
her own apartment in the Avenue
de l’Impératrice. She was so dispirited
at the contemplation of her own
faults and Victor’s supposed Spartan
virtue that she had no heart to take
her usual afternoon automobile excursion
in the Bois de Boulogne—the
automobile being one of the few indulgences
she had been able to screw
out of Papa Bouchard. She remained
at home, therefore, until it was time to
take the eight o’clock train for Melun.
Then, taking her maid to the St. Lazare
station, and directing her to be
there when the eleven o’clock train
from Melun returned, Léontine stepped
into a first-class compartment, and was
soon speeding toward Melun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>She wore a beautiful evening costume
concealed by a long silk cloak,
and a charming hat was perched on
her dainty head. The thought in her
tender little heart was of the pleasure
her society would give her dear Victor.</p>

<p>But her dear Victor had spent the
day in a manner not unlike her own.
He had interviewed the proprietor of
the Pigeon House and had paid half the
bill. The transaction had involved
the mortifying admission that before the
balance was handed over Monsieur
Bouchard would be out there himself
to look into the matter, as if Captain
de Meneval were a naughty schoolboy.
The proprietor of the Pigeon House
had scoffed heartlessly at this, and de
Meneval had difficulty in keeping from
knocking him down for his impudence.
Then—Léontine’s visit! What impish
microbe had lodged in her head,
inducing her to come out there? He
knew her to be keen of wit, and it would
be difficult to disguise from her his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
familiarity with the place. He might,
it is true, say he knew little or nothing
about it, but the waiters, especially one
François, who knew his taste in wines
and cigars, fish and <i>entrées</i> and <i>hors
d’œuvres</i> to a dot, would be sure to
betray him. And then, the diamond
necklace lay heavy on his heart and
danced up and down before his eyes,
for Victor de Meneval really loved his
charming young wife, and argued to
himself that if that stingy old hunks of
a Papa Bouchard had not held him so
tight the present predicament would
not have existed.</p>

<p>However, time waits for no man;
and when the eight o’clock train from
Paris was due Captain de Meneval
was at the little station waiting for it.
And when it rolled in Léontine sprang
gracefully out of her compartment.</p>

<p>As in the morning, each felt remorseful
and penitent toward the other and
tried to make up for the wrong that
each had secretly done the other by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
renewed demonstrations of affection.
When de Meneval escorted his charming
wife across the street to the Pigeon
House, which was only a step away, he
paid her the prettiest and most lover-like
compliments imaginable. Léontine responded
with the sweetest smiles and
the tenderest words; so that by the
time they reached the terrace garden
through a covered hedge next the
Pigeon House itself, each felt like a
thief and a murderer.</p>

<p>Léontine exclaimed with delight at
the beauty of the terrace garden. It
was indeed a pretty and cheerful place.
It looked down straight into a little
valley where the river meandered. An
iron railing and a stone coping defined
the terrace. Trees and shrubbery,
pretty flower beds and a rustic arbor
were lighted by incandescent lamps that
gleamed softly in the purple glow of
evening. The windows of the Pigeon
House gave directly on the terrace,
and already the glittering lights and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
sounds of the orchestra showed that the
performance was beginning. There
were only a few persons scattered
about, and the waiters were collected
in groups, whispering, while waiting
for customers. One, however—the
identical François, whom de Meneval
wished to avoid—ran forward and
showed them a pleasant table. He
was in the act of saying, “What will
Monsieur le Capitaine have?” when
de Meneval, looking him straight in
the face, though addressing Léontine,
said:</p>

<p>“It’s been so long since I’ve seen
this place—not since our marriage, in
fact—that I hardly know what it is
like.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” thought François, “that is
your game, is it? Very well, Monsieur,
I will help you out with it—for
a consideration.” Then, extending his
hand for de Meneval’s hat, he gave a
slight but significant twitch of his fingers
and palm, to which a ten-franc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
piece was the agreeable response.
“Since Monsieur is evidently not familiar
with this place,” said the wily
François, “perhaps he will allow me
to recommend our white soup, to begin
with.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied de Meneval;
“and can you also recommend this
turbot on the menu?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur. If you had ever
tasted our turbot you would never
look at turbot outside of the Pigeon
House.”</p>

<p>“By the way, what is your name?”</p>

<p>“François, if you please.”</p>

<p>François remembered perfectly, that
little supper at the Pigeon House the
week before, when Captain de Meneval
had not only forgotten François’s name
but his own as well, and so had several
other very jolly officers. But François,
though but a waiter, had the soul
of a gentleman, and was nobly oblivious
of ever having set eyes on Captain
de Meneval before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Now, Victor,” said Léontine, who
had been studying the wine list, “as
I invited myself here to-night, I intend
to be part host. I claim the
right of providing the wine and cigars.
They shall be of the best, as the best
of husbands deserves.” Then, turning
to François, she said: “Your best
Chambertin with the soup, and a bottle
of this 1840 Bordeaux, and a bottle
of Veuve Clicquot. Also, for Monsieur
le Capitaine some of your Reina
Regente cigars.” Léontine returned to
her study of the wine list and de Meneval
and François exchanged sympathetic
grins. François vanished after
having received a very expensive order.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, Léontine and
Victor began to condole with each
other on the prospect of their rustication.</p>

<p>“It is not for myself I grieve,” declared
Léontine, “it is for you, poor
darling.”</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” protested de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Meneval. “If only <i>you</i> were not condemned
to that infernal little cottage!
Well, we shall have one good dinner,
anyhow, before we begin doing time,
as it were.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_131">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="And there on the arbor hung a cage with
a parrot in it">
</figure>

<p>And as they were exchanging their
lugubrious confidences, a shriek of
hoarse laughter resounded near them,
and there on the arbor hung a cage
with a parrot in it which Léontine immediately
recognized as Pierrot. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
gurgles of laughter Léontine told Victor
of her visit to the Rue Clarisse
that morning and the flight of Pierrot,
along with that of Papa Bouchard and
Pierre.</p>

<p>“And I shall go to-morrow morning
and tell Aunt Céleste that I have
seen her dear Pierrot.”</p>

<p>“It will be cruelty to animals to
take the poor devil back to the Rue
Clarisse,” replied de Meneval.</p>

<p>François then returned with the
soup and fish, both of which were
excellent. De Meneval made a point
of calling François “Louis” or
“Adolphe” occasionally, and François
never failed to respectfully correct
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sweet sounds of the
orchestra and of singing floated out
from the open windows of the Pigeon
House. More people strolled on the
terrace, including many officers of the
garrison; and when the intermission
came, a flock of girls, each escorted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
a young man, generally an officer, came
out, laughing and chattering, and took
their places at the little tables. Some
had only a glass of lemonade or wine,
others had time for a pâté or some
trifle of the kind. It was very pretty
and picturesque, and Léontine, never
having seen anything of the kind, was
delighted.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_133">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="A flock of girls, each escorted by a young
man, generally an officer">
</figure>

<p>De Meneval was in agony lest some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of his friends among the ladies should
recognize him, but they, being mostly
decent and self-respecting women,
though of a humble class, with true
French politeness did not intrude themselves
on his notice in any way. Nor
was he anxious to begin a conversation
with any of his brother officers,
and carefully avoided noticing them beyond
a bow, although many of them
would have been glad of an introduction
to his pretty young wife.</p>

<p>The dinner was outwardly very jolly,
but the demon of remorse was at work
within the breasts of both Victor and
Léontine. Nevertheless, it did not affect
their appetites, and François found
he had a good deal to do. At last,
however, coffee was served, and just as
Léontine put down her cup a scream
from the parrot resounded.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are, Papa Bouchard!
Up to mischief, eh, Papa Bouchard!
Bad boy Bouchard!”</p>

<p>Now these were some of the phrases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that Léontine herself, during her sojourn
in the Rue Clarisse, had taught
the parrot, much to her own and Papa
Bouchard’s amusement. The wicked
bird remembered them most inopportunely,
for there was Papa
himself strolling into the
garden.</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_135"><img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="Monsieur Bouchard entered with an air
of affected jauntiness"></div>

<p>“Good heavens!” cried
de Meneval. “We can’t
afford to let Papa Bouchard
see us out here. We should
be sent into retirement to-morrow
morning!” And
obeying a mutual impulse,
these two graceless creatures
flew round the corner of the
arbor, where they could see
without being seen.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard entered with an
air of affected jauntiness which went
very well with the extreme youthfulness
of his attire. Apparently he had
thrown all his old clothes to the winds,
along with his discretion, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
decamped from the Rue Clarisse. He
wore an extremely youthful suit of
light gray, with a flaming necktie, a
collar that nearly cut his ears off, and a
watch chain that would have answered
either for a watch or a dog. A huge
red rose decorated his lapel, and his
scanty hair, when he removed his hat,
showed marks of the curling-iron.</p>

<p>At the first shriek from the parrot
Papa Bouchard started apprehensively.
The waiters—a shrewd and vexatious
lot, who never fail to notice all the
slips of elderly gentlemen—immediately
jumped to the right conclusion,
that the elderly gentleman in youthful
attire was an old acquaintance of the
newly acquired parrot. Monsieur Bouchard
felt, rather than saw, a simultaneous
snicker go round, and rightly
concluding that the best thing to do
was to ignore the wicked Pierrot,
walked away from the arbor, and seating
himself at a table some distance
away, pulled out of his pocket the <i>Journal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
des Débats</i> and read it diligently.
The parrot, however, delighted to find
an old acquaintance among so many
new faces, continued to call out, at
intervals, various remarks to Papa Bouchard,
such as “Does the old lady
know you’re out?” “Oh, you are a
gay bird, Papa Bouchard!” and always
winding up, like a Greek chorus, with
“Bad boy Bouchard!”</p>

<p>Presently a waiter approached and
asked Monsieur Bouchard politely what
he wished to be served with, and before
he could ask for his usual drink, a little
sugared water, the diabolical Pierrot
screeched out, “An American cocktail!”
which the bird pronounced
“cockee-tailee.” Papa Bouchard
scowled. This was very annoying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“A little sugared water, if you
please,” he replied to the waiter, and
the bird, on hearing it, burst into a
screech of hoarse laughter.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_138">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="At that very moment Léontine and de
Meneval were watching him">
</figure>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard laid down his
newspaper and looked about him with
curiosity not unmixed with gratification.
Everything seemed extremely
jolly—these places were undoubtedly
pleasant, and he was not so much surprised
as he had been at de Meneval’s
fondness for it. At that very moment
de Meneval and Léontine were watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
him and counting the chances of
slipping out without being caught. But
Papa Bouchard, quite unconscious of
this, was becoming more and more interested
in what was going on before
him and around him. “At these places,
though,” he was thinking, “one should
have a companion—a person of the
other sex—someone to help one enjoy—it’s
dreary trying to be happy alone.”
And as if in answer to his thought,
he saw, entering the garden in both
haste and embarrassment, the charming
Madame Vernet.</p>

<p>Now, a curious thing happened—a
psychologic mystery. All day long
Monsieur Bouchard had been haunted
and troubled by the thought of Madame
Vernet and the paste necklace. She
had not returned it. So much he knew
from his first look at Pierre’s countenance
when he had got home that
afternoon. But the minute he saw the
lady herself, in his pleased flutter and
twitter of enjoyment, the necklace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
vanished from his consciousness; he
remembered only that she was pretty,
she was young, she was demure and she
was easily alarmed. In fact, Madame
Vernet appeared to be scared half to
death at this very instant, and as soon
as she caught sight of Monsieur
Bouchard she fled toward him like a
frightened bird.</p>

<p>“Oh, Monsieur Bouchard!” she
said, panting and agitated, “how relieved
I am to find you here! I had
an appointment to meet my uncle and
aunt here—you remember I told you
I had an uncle and aunt living at
Melun whom I often visited—and not
seeing them outside I took it for granted
they were inside, and so came in. I
felt terribly embarrassed—I am so diffident,
you know—at entering such a
place alone, but I expected every
moment to see them, and when I did
not I thought I should have fainted
from sheer terror—you can’t imagine
what a timid little thing I am—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
then my eyes fell on you, and I said to
myself: ‘There is that dear, good,
handsome Monsieur Bouchard—he is
the very man to take care of a poor,
terrified woman’—and so I ran to
you.” Madame Vernet dropped on a
chair at Monsieur Bouchard’s table.</p>

<p>What man with a soul as big as the
head of a pin could refuse succor to a
pretty woman under these circumstances!
Not Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>“My dear Madame Vernet,” he
said, “pray compose yourself. I will
take care of you until your uncle and
aunt arrive.”</p>

<p>Madame Vernet looked around apprehensively.</p>

<p>“I don’t see my uncle and aunt,”
she murmured—which was perfectly
true—“and I am afraid, very much
afraid, Monsieur Bouchard, that your
youthful appearance really unfits you
for the office of chaperon.”</p>

<p>Oh, how happy was Papa Bouchard
at that! With liberty seemed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
come youth—with youth should come
champagne. Papa Bouchard called
the waiter back and changed his order
from a glass of sugared water to a quart
of extra dry Veuve Clicquot.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, playfully taking up
Madame Vernet’s fan, “don’t worry
your little head about your uncle and
aunt. I’ll be your uncle and aunt for
this evening. I’m sure I have been
told by a number of persons—members
of my own family—that the
Pigeon House is a perfectly respectable
place. So let us have a pleasant evening
here, and I will take you back to
Paris by the eleven o’clock train.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Monsieur Bouchard, there is
nothing I should like better, but I am
afraid——”</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t be afraid. There
isn’t the least chance of anyone I
know turning up. I have a young
jackanapes of a family connection stationed
here—a young officer—but I
think I have pretty effectually shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the door of the Pigeon House in <i>his</i>
face.”</p>

<p>At that very moment this young
jackanapes of an officer was watching
and listening to Papa Bouchard with
the most entrancing delight. So was
Léontine, who could not refrain from
pinching de Meneval in her ecstasy.
The enjoyment of these two young
scapegraces was enhanced at this very
moment by the parrot screaming out:</p>

<p>“Oh, naughty old Bouchard! I’ll
tell the old lady! Bad boy Bouchard!”</p>

<p>Madame Vernet started and looked
inquiringly at the bird. Papa Bouchard
was seriously vexed.</p>

<p>“Pray,” he said, in an annoyed
voice, “don’t pay any attention to that
ridiculous bird. I always thought parrots
were the incarnation of the devil.
I can’t imagine how the creature found
out my name. At all events,” he
added, tenderly, “neither bird nor devil,
neither man nor woman, nor even your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
aunt and uncle, can spoil the evening
for us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think my aunt and uncle
can be coming,” replied Madame Vernet.
And she spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” whispered
Papa Bouchard.</p>

<p>The waiter, the same astute François
who had waited on de Meneval
and Léontine, now appeared with the
champagne. Monsieur Bouchard had
not thought of ordering anything to
eat, but when this artful François said
to him, “Did Monsieur ask for a
menu card?” Monsieur Bouchard replied,
promptly, “Certainly I did.”</p>

<p>The menu was brought, and Monsieur
Bouchard, with his head close to
Madame Vernet’s, studied it attentively.
His order as finally made out
would have caused an earthquake in
the Rue Clarisse. He ordered everything
that had been strictly forbidden
during the last thirty years. The order
bore, too, a really remarkable resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to the one given by the de
Menevals, except that those happy-go-lucky
young people had not the money
to pay for it, and Monsieur Bouchard
had.</p>

<p>Never in all his life had Papa Bouchard
enjoyed a supper as much as that
one. He was at perfect liberty to eat
and drink all the things that were certain
to make him feel ill the next day,
a prerogative dear to a man’s heart.
He had a charming woman opposite
him, and a waiter who fairly overwhelmed
him with attentions. Without
an order from Monsieur Bouchard,
François produced the wine appropriate
to every course, and instead of being
frowned on was rewarded for it. But
in spite of white wines and red wines,
Papa Bouchard stuck pretty close to
the champagne, which speedily got into
his tongue and his eyes as well as into
his blood. It was the champagne that
made him squeeze Madame Vernet’s
hand under the table, wink at François<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and kiss his fingers to one of the young
ladies of the ballet, who responded by
playfully throwing a bouquet to him
which hit him on the nose. In fact,
his enjoyment would have been entirely
without alloy but for Pierrot, who,
slyly inspired by the waiters, kept up a
running fire of remarks, always ending
in a shrill laugh and a yell of “Bad
boy Bouchard!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_146">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="Papa Bouchard stuck pretty close to the
champagne">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>If Pierrot bothered Papa Bouchard
slightly, he added immensely to the
suppressed gaiety of the two listeners,
de Meneval and Léontine, and they
went off into spasms of silent laughter
whenever Pierrot screamed out any
appropriate remark.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, however, got a good
deal of solid enjoyment out of his
supper in spite of his old friend of the
Rue Clarisse, and Pierrot did not interfere
in the least with Madame Vernet’s
pleasure.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said Monsieur Bouchard,
confidentially, to Madame Vernet,
after the third glass of champagne,
“I wasn’t quite candid about that
devilish bird.” Papa Bouchard used
this wicked word with the greatest
relish. “It belonged to my sister—older
than I—who brought me up
in the way I should go, and a deuced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
dull and uncomfortable way it was!
A day or two ago, Pierrot—that’s the
parrot’s name—got tired of the propriety
and seclusion of the Rue Clarisse,
where we have lived for thirty
years, just as Pierre, my man-servant,
did, and I myself. All at once, without
any previous consultation, Pierre,
Pierrot and I levanted, so to speak.
Pierrot has evidently got caught—which
is more than I intend to be—but
I’m sure he finds the Pigeon House
a great improvement on the Rue Clarisse,
and I haven’t the heart to return him
there. You don’t know how pleasant
it is to be living in the Rue Bassano
after thirty years in the Rue Clarisse.
And to be my own man, instead of
my sister’s—excellent woman she is,
excellent, but she doesn’t understand
what a young man of the present day—er—I
mean a man with the feelings
of youth, requires to make him happy.
So that’s why I eloped.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great mistake not to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a man his head sometimes,” added
Madame Vernet, with one of her gentle
and winning smiles.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes. You know how to
manage a man, I see.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> manage a man!” cried Madame
Vernet. “Pray don’t say that. The
idea of my managing a great, strong
man! No, indeed! All I should ask
of a man is that he would manage me—and
I’m sure, as yielding as I am,
nothing would be easier.”</p>

<p>At which François, behind Monsieur
Bouchard’s chair, doubled up
with laughter, and Léontine had to fan
de Meneval, who appeared to be choking
in an agony of enjoyment, while
Pierrot varied his performance by beginning
to sing the song from the opera,
“Ah, I have sighed to rest me!”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Papa Bouchard,
whose <i>bonhomie</i> increased with every
sip of champagne, “I suppose I shall
have to manage a woman some day,
for, to be very confidential, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Madame Vernet, I am in an excellent
position to marry, and after a while I
think I shall not be satisfied with
liberty. I shall want power, too—the
power of controlling another destiny,
another heart, another will besides my
own; so I shall marry a wife.” Papa
Bouchard said this with an air of the
greatest determination, swelling out
his waistcoat, and at the same moment
the parrot shrieked out laughing, “Oh,
what an old fool!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that?”
cried Monsieur Bouchard, indignantly,
turning to François. He was a little
confused by the champagne and Madame
Vernet’s bright eyes.</p>

<p>“If you please, Monsieur, it is that
troublesome parrot. I shall tell the
proprietor how very annoying the bird
is—he has only just got it—and I am
sure to-morrow morning it will be
sent away.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard had to be satisfied
with this. His enjoyment, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
was now too deep for Pierrot to
ruffle except for a moment. Monsieur
Bouchard was living—living cycles of
time, and life was taking on a color,
an exuberance, a melody that quite
turned his otherwise excellent head.
He was delighted with Madame Vernet’s
exposition of her inability and
indisposition to manage a man.
“That’s the sort of wife I’ll have
when I marry,” he thought to himself,
taking another shy at the champagne.
“None of your managing sort—I’ve
been managed too much already,
heaven knows.” And inspired
by these pleasing reflections, he said,
tenderly, to Madame Vernet, offering
her his arm:</p>

<p>“Come, Madame, let us take a little
stroll in search of your uncle and
aunt. Do you see that sweet, retired
little alley, all roses and myrtles and
honeysuckles, with a lot of cooing
pigeons nestling among them? Perhaps
we may find your uncle and aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
amid the roses. And, Madame, I may
say to you, I don’t want a managing
wife, and I don’t know any man who
does. I want a dependent creature—sturdy
oak and clinging vine, you know—I
want a clinger. And if she has
already tried her hand on another man,
so much the better. I get the benefit
of her experience. The fact is, Madame,
I was born to console—I’m a
consoler of the first water. Now, pray
take my arm and let us explore the
wilderness of roses and myrtles.”</p>

<p>Madame Vernet hung her head, but
Papa Bouchard insisted. When at last
she rose she threw aside the graceful
little wrap round her shoulders, and
there, gleaming on her throat, was the
paste necklace.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard received a distinct
and unpleasant shock as he recognized
the troublesome object, and
he was nowise relieved by Madame
Vernet saying, in her softest and most
insinuating manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“How charming it was of you to
give me this lovely ornament!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard would have
dropped Madame Vernet’s arm, but
she held on to him. This was certainly
a very disagreeable incident.
He had not given her the necklace—he
never dreamed of giving it to her—he
had been very much annoyed at
her failure to return it, and——</p>

<p>But what were Monsieur Bouchard’s
feelings in comparison with those of
Léontine and de Meneval, both of
whom were watching every movement
of Papa Bouchard and Madame
Vernet? Their laughing faces changed
like magic. They stood—Léontine
and Victor—horror-stricken, and as
if turned to stone, each pale, trembling,
and afraid to meet the eye of the other.
But as, after a minute or two of agonized
surprise, they began to recover
from the first shock of their discovery,
they felt the necessity of concealing
their feelings from each other, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the same time not losing sight of the
forty thousand franc necklace.</p>

<p>Léontine, womanlike, was the first
to rally. She was quite pale—de
Meneval was not sure whether she
had recognized the necklace or not,
and he was afraid to ask. Her voice
trembled slightly as she said:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go and speak to Papa
Bouchard. It will be such—such fun
to let him know we have been watching
him all the time.”</p>

<p>Out of sheer stupidity, and being
thoroughly disconcerted, de Meneval
walked along with her toward Monsieur
Bouchard and Madame Vernet.
Léontine jumped to the conclusion
that he suspected something. So she
stopped short and said, in a voice that
she vainly tried to make laughing and
merry:</p>

<p>“Let me have Papa Bouchard to
myself—it will be the more amusing
if you appear later on.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied de Meneval,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and continued to walk with her
toward Papa Bouchard and Madame
Vernet. The fact is, he had not
heard a word of what Léontine was
saying. Papa Bouchard was standing
in front of Madame Vernet, and his
countenance showed that all was not
at ease within. She had asked him
to button her glove, and he could not
well refuse, but the sight of the necklace
was rather trying to his nerves.
And in the midst of it appeared the
two human beings he least desired
to see on earth—Léontine and de
Meneval!</p>

<p>The three stood looking at each
other like a trio of criminals. Madame
Vernet, the blushing, the bashful, the
diffident, was the only one of the
four who was not cruelly embarrassed.
And then, besides the infernal necklace—for
so Papa Bouchard characterized
it in his new vocabulary—the
idea of being caught supping with
a lady at the Pigeon House! Suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
those two scamps should fly off to the
Rue Clarisse with the gruesome tale—and
he didn’t know exactly how
much champagne he had taken, only
his head was buzzing a little—poor,
poor Papa Bouchard! However, it
would never do to show the white
feather in the beginning; the champagne
had given him some Dutch
courage, but it did not supply him
with any judgment, for his first remark
was about the most indiscreet he could
have made. Assuming, or trying to
assume, his usual authoritative air, he
said to de Meneval:</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Capitaine, I thought
there was a distinct understanding between
us that there were to be no more
suppers at the Pigeon House. And
bringing your wife to this place——”</p>

<p>“I know of no such understanding,
Monsieur Bouchard,” replied de Meneval,
with some spirit. “I deny your
right, or that of any other man, to
say where I shall have supper with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
wife. If the Pigeon House is proper
enough for you and this lady—” de
Meneval indicated Madame Vernet,
who, with her usual bashfulness, had
retired a little—“whom I overheard
just now thanking you for the superb
necklace she wears, it is assuredly proper
for me and for my wife.”</p>

<p>This was unanswerable logic, and
Papa Bouchard was momentarily staggered
by it. De Meneval followed up
his advantage by saying, significantly,
“To-morrow morning I shall come to
see you, and you will kindly explain
to me some mysteries concerning—”
De Meneval stopped short; he could
not speak his mind to Monsieur Bouchard
without letting the terrible and
menacing cat out of the bag regarding
the necklace.</p>

<p>It was now Léontine’s turn at the
poor gentleman.</p>

<p>“Come, Papa Bouchard,” she said,
with pallid lips, but affecting to laugh,
“you must not scold Victor for bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
me here. I really made him do it.
But I want to speak to you a moment
in that sweet, sequestered arbor, where
you told this lady just now she might
find her uncle and aunt, amid the roses
and honeysuckles and the little cooing
pigeons.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_158">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_158.jpg" alt="Madame Vernet had not the slightest objection
to be left in charge of this good-looking
young officer">
</figure>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard would much
rather have gone off with a gendarme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
at that very moment, but Léontine
had him by the arm, and was determinedly
dragging him away. An
anxious grin appeared on his countenance
as he turned to Madame Vernet
and said:</p>

<p>“One moment, Madame, and I will
return.”</p>

<p>“Only a moment, remember,” answered
this bashful creature.</p>

<p>Madame Vernet had not the slightest
objection to being left in charge
of this good-looking young officer.
She cast down her eyes and began to
murmur something about her timidity,
when she was brought up all standing
by de Meneval saying:</p>

<p>“Madame, a few moments ago I
overheard you thanking Monsieur
Bouchard for that superb necklace you
wear.”</p>

<p>Madame Vernet smiled. Superb
necklace, indeed! It must be a fine
imitation.</p>

<p>“But,” continued de Meneval,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
“that necklace belongs to my wife,
Madame de Meneval. I myself selected
it, and paid forty thousand francs
for it. Last night I left it in Monsieur
Bouchard’s care in the Rue Bassano.
To-night I find you, a woman
with whom, I am sure, Monsieur Bouchard
has a very casual acquaintance,
wearing my wife’s forty thousand franc
necklace. You will admit that the
circumstances justify me in demanding
the necklace.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” replied Madame Vernet,
“this necklace is paste. It cost
only seventy-five francs. I have Monsieur
Bouchard’s word for it.”</p>

<p>“The old sinner! Well, Monsieur
Bouchard wasn’t saying his prayers
when he told you that. I tell you the
stones are real, and unless you hand
the necklace over to me this instant I
shall telephone for a couple of policemen—there
is a police station not
two minutes away—and to-morrow
morning you and Monsieur Bouchard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
can explain the matter in the police
court.”</p>

<p>Now, Madame Vernet was really
as brave as a lion. She suspected at
once that she had got hold of something
of actual value, and she determined
to hold on to it and get away with it;
hence nothing could have been more
pleasing to her at that moment than to
have de Meneval out of the way for a
few moments—even to fetch a policeman—so
she merely replied, with
calm assurance:</p>

<p>“Do as you like, Monsieur. I never
saw you before—I hope I shall never
see you again. My protector is at
hand, and when you arrive with your
police officers it is Monsieur Bouchard
with whom you will have to settle.”</p>

<p>De Meneval turned and ran out of
the garden toward the police station.
He thought that exposure was coming
anyhow, and he had better secure the
stakes in the game. As he rushed out
he caromed against a very well-dressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
portly, clean-shaven elderly gentleman,
who was parading into the garden
with a great air of pomposity. In his
hand he held conspicuously a newspaper,
on the first page of which was a
large photogravure easily recognizable as
himself, and under it, in letters an inch
long, were the words,</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Dr. Delcasse</span><br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">The Most Celebrated Alienist<br>
in Paris.</span></p>

<p>Below this was the cut of a handsome
building, and under this was inscribed,
“The Private Sanatorium at Melun of
Dr. Delcasse.”</p>

<p>Dr. Delcasse seemed to feel the injury
to his dignity very much when
de Meneval jostled by him so unceremoniously,
nearly knocking him down.
He stopped, scowled, growled, and then,
with a portentous air of being much
displeased, stalked forward, took a seat
close to where Madame Vernet was
standing, and began pompously to unfold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
his newspaper, always keeping the
picture to his audience, so to speak—which
audience consisted solely of Madame
Vernet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_163">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_163.jpg" alt="He took a seat close to where Madame
Vernet was standing">
</figure>

<p>Now, for quickness and boldness of
resource Madame Vernet was fully the
equal of de Meneval or any man alive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and the moment she became convinced
of the identity of Dr. Delcasse a plan
was formed in her mind. Everybody
knew Dr. Delcasse, and also of the
war waged between him and Dr.
Vignaud, another celebrated alienist,
which, if carried to extremes, would
have resulted in locking up half the
population of Paris as lunatics either
in Dr. Delcasse’s sanatorium at Melun
or Dr. Vignaud’s private hospital in
Paris.</p>

<p>Madame Vernet realized, in her
brilliant scheme, the value of time.
There was a train leaving for Paris in
ten minutes. If she could but make
the first train, getting away before
Monsieur Bouchard returned! She
determined to at least try for it. She
came near to Dr. Delcasse, and said,
in a silvery voice:</p>

<p>“May I ask if this is not the renowned
Dr. Delcasse—the man who
has restored the largest number of
persons, cured and sane, to their families,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of any doctor for the insane in
the whole world?”</p>

<p>To this insinuating address from a
remarkably pretty and attractive woman
Dr. Delcasse, as would any other man,
felt a warming of the heart, and he
replied, rising politely:</p>

<p>“You flatter me. I <i>am</i> Dr. Delcasse.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Madame Vernet,
taking out her handkerchief and preparing
to weep, “you are the man I
most desire to meet. Oh, how fortunate
it is for me that you are here! I
have a brother with me—a dear, good
young man, but whose mind has been
affected ever since a fall he had from
an apricot tree some years ago. For
a year I had him at Dr. Vignaud’s
hospital for the insane—rightly named,
for I think anyone who went there
would shortly be insane. Dr. Vignaud
is a charlatan of the worst
description.” Dr. Delcasse smiled in
a superior manner to hear himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
praised and Dr. Vignaud reviled—how
delicious! “I am my poor
brother’s guardian,” continued Madame
Vernet, producing her card, inscribed
“Madame Vernet, <i>née</i> Brion.”
“My brother’s name is Louis Brion.
Ever since he was released from Dr.
Vignaud’s asylum he has been much
crazier than when he went in, although
Dr. Vignaud declared him
thoroughly cured.”</p>

<p>“Just like Vignaud!” remarked Dr.
Delcasse, with that spirit of fraternity
which sometimes distinguishes the
medical profession.</p>

<p>“This evening,” continued Madame
Vernet, throwing her most pleading
and fascinating look into her eyes,
“I brought my poor, dear brother out
to this place to supper, thinking it
would divert him. But he has been
quite insane in all his actions, and just
now he became violent. He took it
into his head that this necklace I wear—which
I may say to you confidentially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
is paste—is real, and is worth forty
thousand francs, and that I have
stolen it from his wife. The poor
boy has no wife. And while I was
trying to soothe him just now he suddenly
broke away, nearly knocking
you down as you came in, and declared
he was going after the police to
arrest me—<i>me</i>, his devoted sister!”
Madame Vernet’s voice became lost
in her lace handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I saw an unmistakable gleam of
insanity in his eye as he rushed by
me,” said Dr. Delcasse, promptly.
“My experience, Madame, has been
vast. I can tell an insane patient at
a glance, and I have no hesitation in
saying that the young man gave every
indication to a practiced eye of being,
as you say, very much unbalanced.
And Vignaud said he was cured! Ha,
ha!”</p>

<p>“But the great thing,” said Madame
Vernet, with real and not pretended
anxiety, “is to get him away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
here without scandal, and into your
sanatorium, where I wish to place him
under your care. How can that be
managed?”</p>

<p>“Nothing easier, Madame,” replied
Dr. Delcasse, eager to get hold of one
of Dr. Vignaud’s patients. “I am
well known here—indeed, I am personally
acquainted with many of our
police officers. When the young man
returns with the officers I shall simply,
with your permission, direct them
to convey him to my sanatorium—it
is less than half a mile from here—and
I will telephone to my assistant
to have a strait-jacket, a padded cell
and a cold douche ready for the unfortunate
young man, and we will
take care of him, never fear. When
I release him, depend upon it, he will
be actually cured. I am not Dr. Vignaud,
I beg you to believe.”</p>

<p>At this moment de Meneval, with a
couple of officers, was entering the
garden. The police station, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
had said, was but two minutes away.
Dr. Delcasse, accompanied by Madame
Vernet, coolly advanced, and recognizing
the officers, spoke to them civilly,
saying:</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Lestocq; good-evening,
Caron.” And then to de
Meneval he said, soothingly: “Good-evening,
Monsieur Brion. I am pleased
to see you and your charming sister at
Melun, and think you will enjoy your
stay with me.”</p>

<p>De Meneval looked from one to the
other in amazement, and opened his
mouth to speak; but before he could
get out a word Madame Vernet laid
her hand on his arm and said, in the
tone of soothing a raving lunatic:</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Louis, Dr. Delcasse
will take the best possible care of you,
and I will come out to see you every
week.”</p>

<p>De Meneval found his tongue then.</p>

<p>“To the devil with Dr. Delcasse!
I never heard of him before. Police,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
arrest this woman. I can prove by my
wife and by a gentleman now in this
garden that the diamond necklace this
person wears is the property of my
wife.”</p>

<p>“Do nothing of the kind,” interrupted
Dr. Delcasse, with quiet authority.
“This young man, Louis Brion, is
the brother of this lady, Madame Vernet.
He is demented, and his latest hallucination
is that Madame Vernet has stolen
the necklace she wears; that it is worth
forty thousand francs, that she stole
it from his wife—and he has no
wife.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you,” shouted de Meneval,
quite beside himself, “that I never
saw this woman before. She has my
wife’s diamond necklace, and I can
prove it. Call Monsieur Bouchard!”</p>

<p>“You see how it is,” coolly remarked
Dr. Delcasse to the two police officers,
“the only thing is to get him out of the
way as quietly as possible. I shall take
him at once out to my sanatorium, where
I will have a strait-jacket, a padded cell
and a cold douche waiting for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171-172]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_171">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_171.jpg" alt="The police officers seized him, and dragged him out, under Dr. Delcasse’s direction">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">The police officers seized him, and dragged him out, under Dr. Delcasse’s direction.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>With this the Doctor suddenly
whipped out his silk handkerchief, and
with the greatest ingenuity bound it
fast round de Meneval’s mouth, so that
he was completely gagged and silenced.
The police officers seized him, and
dragged him out, under Dr. Delcasse’s
direction. De Meneval fought like a
tiger, but it was one to three. The
struggle, though violent, was noiseless,
and before the two or three waiters in
the vicinity realized what was going on
everything was over, and Madame Vernet,
picking up her gloves, fan and
other belongings, scurried off another
way to make the ten o’clock train.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the interview between
Papa Bouchard and Léontine had been
stormy. Léontine had demanded an
explanation, but Papa Bouchard had no
satisfactory one to give. At first he
mounted his high horse, declared Léontine’s
suspicions intolerable, and refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
to discuss the subject of the necklace
at all. But she was not so easily put
off.</p>

<p>“If you refuse me an explanation,”
she said at last, “I shall simply confess
all to Victor, and you will have to treat
with a man instead of a woman.”</p>

<p>“Do; confess all to Victor,” replied
Papa Bouchard, tartly. “Tell him that
sociological yarn you told me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to,” replied Léontine, so
dolefully, that it partially softened Monsieur
Bouchard, who really had a good
heart.</p>

<p>“Come, come, now,” he said. “You
had better take my word for it when I
tell you that, in spite of appearances,
your necklace is safe. I can’t and
won’t tell you the circumstances—you
and de Meneval would both blazon it
over Paris, and it would be devilish uncomfortable—”
Papa Bouchard was
becoming expert in the use of bad language—“it
would be devilish uncomfortable
for me. I can straighten the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
whole thing out in a few days, if you
will only keep quiet. <i>Can’t</i> you keep
quiet?”</p>

<p>By this time they were re-entering
the garden.</p>

<p>“I will agree to keep quiet for a
week,” said Léontine, firmly. “At
the end of that time, if this unpleasant
complication about my necklace is not
cleared up, I have a presentiment that
the whole thing will get into the newspapers.
Just fancy the headlines, ‘Mystery
of Madame de Meneval’s Diamond
Necklace. Monsieur Paul Bouchard
Proved to have Given it to an Adventuress,
With Whom he was Caught at
the Pigeon House.’”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard felt his knees grow a
little weak under him, and went and
sat down in the chair he had lately
vacated. Léontine followed him and
said dramatically, as if reading the scare
head in a great metropolitan daily.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Suicide</span> of Monsieur Paul Bouchard!
The late Advocate Discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in his Apartment With a Pistol Wound
Through his Temple! The Apartment
presents the Appearance of a Shambles!
Blood Over Everything!! Walls and
Ceilings Much Bespattered!!!’”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, very white around
the lips, poured out with an unsteady
hand a glass of champagne, and drank
it, the glass clinking against his teeth.</p>

<p>“Léontine,” he said, after having
drained the glass. “You are trying to
frighten me. But you can’t do it. You
sha’n’t do it. And I insist that you
shall not be carrying any of your sensational
tales to the Rue Clarisse, alarming
my poor sister, and making her
life a torment. Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I do,” replied Léontine.
“And, by the way, where is your
lady friend?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard looked around
for Madame Vernet, and was much
disturbed at not seeing her. In the
perplexities and annoyances of the last
half-hour he had made up his mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
it was absolutely necessary to get that
diabolical necklace back, and to work
himself out of the scrape in which he
unexpectedly found himself.</p>

<p>He called up François, who reported
that Madame Vernet had gone out in a
great hurry. There was a train for Paris
just leaving. It struck him Madame
was trying to make that train. Such
was precisely Monsieur Bouchard’s idea.
Her departure in this way seriously annoyed
and alarmed him. One thing,
however, was clear in his mind—he
must get back to Paris as soon as possible.
There was another train in twenty
minutes, and then there would be no
more till eleven.</p>

<p>De Meneval’s disappearance was also
strange, but just as Léontine was beginning
to feel uncomfortable she saw de
Meneval approaching. Something unusual
had evidently happened. He
looked angry and excited, and his usually
immaculate dress showed that he
had been in a scrimmage. By his side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
walked the portly, the imposing Dr.
Delcasse. The Doctor was apologizing
to de Meneval with the utmost
earnestness.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I beg you will believe it
was a most extraordinary mistake——”</p>

<p>“<i>Very</i> extraordinary!” replied de
Meneval, grinding his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>“If I had succeeded in getting you
into my sanatorium you would have
found every comfort awaiting you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a strait-jacket, a cold douche,
and a padded cell, as you kindly promised
me.”</p>

<p>“May I ask, Monsieur, that you
will not spread this unfortunate story
abroad in Paris?”</p>

<p>“I shall have it printed in every
newspaper in Paris to-morrow morning,
and I shall myself write to Dr.
Vignaud, giving him a detailed account
of the affair.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!”</p>

<p>“And if insanity ever develops in
my family, it is Dr. Vignaud who shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
treat every case—every case, do you
hear?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_179">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="Go to the devil!">
</figure>

<p>“Then, sir,” said Dr. Delcasse, angrily,
“all I have to say is that I am
not at all sure my first diagnosis was
not correct, and you are indeed, already
crazy—and I have the honor to bid
you good-evening.”</p>

<p>“Go to the devil!”</p>

<p>Dr. Delcasse, slapping his hat down
angrily on his head, marched indignantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
out, and de Meneval, still furious
at the treatment to which he had been
subjected, poured out his injuries:</p>

<p>“And but for having been recognized
by some of the waiters as I was
being dragged away I should at this
moment be an inmate of a lunatic
asylum, sent there by the wiles of a
shameless adventuress, brought to the
Pigeon House by Monsieur Bouchard.”
This was de Meneval’s exact language.</p>

<p>“Take care, sir; take care!” cried
Papa Bouchard, in a voice trembling
with wrath. He was not accustomed
to being talked to in that manner.
“You may repent of this language.
Madame Vernet is a lady of means and
respectability. I did not bring her out
here. She came expecting to find here
her uncle and aunt, who live in Melun.
I invited her to sup in a public place,
as any gentleman is authorized to do in
the case of a widow old enough to take
care of herself—and because your suspicions
were excited by her having on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
a necklace like that you bought for
your wife, you proceeded to make
trouble. Well, it seems she turned
the tables on you very cleverly, and no
doubt, being a bashful little thing, she
dreaded the sensation it would make
and the notoriety which might follow,
and—and so, naturally, has gone.”
Then, turning to Léontine, Papa Bouchard
played his trump card. “Haven’t
you your diamond necklace safe at
home, Léontine?”</p>

<p>To which Léontine faltered:
“Y—y—yes, Papa Bouchard.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” cried Papa Bouchard,
assuming an air of triumphant virtue to
poor de Meneval, “I hope you see the
enormity of your conduct.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I do,” sullenly replied
de Meneval.</p>

<p>“Very well, very well,” continued
Papa Bouchard, realizing that he held
all the trumps in the game. “Do you
want to go into the whole business of
this necklace? If you do there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
time like the present. Do you, Léontine,
want the matter sifted to the
bottom?”</p>

<p>De Meneval remained gloomily silent,
while Léontine murmured, “N—no,
Papa Bouchard.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, having thus effectually
silenced both of them, felt master
of the situation, but all the same, he
was desperately anxious to reach Paris
in advance of the de Menevals, so that
he could get on Madame Vernet’s track
before they should. He was pretty
sure that she could not slip away from
her apartment without leaving some
trace. There was another train going
almost immediately, and there would
be no more till eleven o’clock. It
would be exceedingly convenient for
him to get an hour’s start of the de
Menevals. So it occurred to him that
if he were to propose a little more
champagne Léontine and de Meneval
would never run away and leave it,
but <i>he</i> could and would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Now,” said he, with an air of
benevolence, “everything having been
straightened out about the necklace,
suppose we have a bottle of champagne
before returning to Paris. Here,
waiter!”</p>

<p>François immediately responded with
a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>De Meneval had never supposed that
anything would be too pressing to drag
him away from good champagne, but
he inwardly swore, as Léontine silently
fretted, at the delay that might prevent
him from making the next train to
Paris. Both of them gulped down the
champagne rather than drank it, while
Papa Bouchard, alleging that he had
already taken several glasses, declined
any more. Every moment or two he
looked at his watch, and he said to
Léontine:</p>

<p>“Will you be going back to Paris
to-night, Léontine?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I shall,” eagerly replied
Léontine. “I shall go back with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“But I sha’n’t be going back till the
midnight train. You see I am beginning
to keep late hours, to make up for
lost time, and that will be too late for
you. Why can’t you remain at de
Meneval’s quarters?”</p>

<p>“I have an engagement early to-morrow
morning,” replied Léontine,
who was determined to get to Paris
as quickly as she could and make
some private inquiries on her own
account concerning Madame Vernet.
The same intention was fixed in de
Meneval’s mind. Therefore he said:</p>

<p>“Never mind, Léontine; I am off
duty till twelve o’clock to-morrow, and
I will take you to Paris to-night, if you
wish.”</p>

<p>At which Léontine, looking very
blank, replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. That will be
nice.”</p>

<p>“Now, why are you in such a hurry
to get to Paris?” asked Papa Bouchard.
“The next train is always crowded—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
a seat to be had in a first-class
compartment for love or money, and
it makes a stop of only two minutes
and a half;
unless one is
already at the
station it is
almost impossible
to make it, and
you see it is now within
a few minutes of the train.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_185">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_185.jpg" alt="All three of them bolted for the exit to the
garden">
</figure>

<p>While Monsieur Bouchard was speaking
he was putting on his gloves and
making for the garden door, and the
de Menevals, each carefully avoiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
an appearance of haste, were following
him. Everybody had forgotten that the
champagne was not paid for, except
François.</p>

<p>“So,” kept on Papa Bouchard, still
edging away, “you will go by the late
train; perhaps I’ll wait for it myself.”</p>

<p>At that moment the shriek of the
locomotive resounded. Immediately
every pretense of waiting for the other
train vanished. All three of them
bolted for the exit to the garden.
François rushed after them, bawling,
“Your bill, Monsieur—the champagne—and
the tip—” while the
parrot, suddenly wakened from a nap,
uttered a screech of demoniac laughter
and began to yell after Papa Bouchard’s
rapidly retreating figure:</p>

<p>“Bad boy Bouchard! bad boy Bouchard!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANYONE who saw Monsieur
Bouchard a week after his
adventures at the Pigeon House would
have said that the excellent man had
grown ten years older in that time.
For he had endured more cares, anxieties,
worries, vexations, apprehensions
and palpitations in that one week in
the Rue Bassano than in all his thirty
years in the Rue Clarisse. Not that
Monsieur Bouchard had the slightest
desire to go back to his old life. Not
at all. In the Rue Bassano he at least
lived; in the Rue Clarisse he had merely
vegetated.</p>

<p>In the first place, on his arrival at
his apartment shortly after midnight on
that fateful evening spent at Melun he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
had been unable to find out anything
at all about Madame Vernet. The
<i>concierge</i> had gone to bed when he got
home, and he dared not disturb the
whole house at that hour. He spent
a sleepless night, with Pierre snoring
peacefully in the next room. The
fellow had not come home till two
o’clock in the morning. Monsieur
Bouchard utilized the watches of the
night in making up a story to tell the
<i>concierge</i> to account for the enquiries he
meant to make concerning Madame
Vernet. A <i>concierge</i>, he well knew, is
the nearest approach to an omniscient
being on this planet. It was comparatively
easy to concoct a tale that would
go on four legs, in the expressive phrase
of his countrymen. Monsieur Bouchard
was vastly pleased with his own
shrewdness when he paused to think
of the facility with which he invented
his story. But to get it accepted at its
face value—ah, that was another thing.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
tiptoed down stairs in his dressing
gown and slippers. The <i>concierge</i>,
yawning, was just opening the shutters
in her little den.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, my good woman,”
said Monsieur Bouchard, in
a manner calculated to allay any suspicions
the <i>concierge</i> might have—if
anything can allay the suspicions of
a <i>concierge</i>—“whether Madame Vernet
arrived here last night—in fact, if
she is in the house at present? I ask
because I promised her aunt and uncle
out at Melun last evening to escort her
in, and by some accident we became
separated in the railway station, and I
am considering what apology I shall
make to her aunt and uncle—very
worthy people at Melun.”</p>

<p>The <i>concierge</i> looked at poor Monsieur
Bouchard, not with suspicion,
but with certainty in her eye. The
very expression of her face called him a
liar and a villain, as she replied, coolly:</p>

<p>“Madame Vernet <i>did</i> come in last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
night and left the house at five o’clock
this morning, to visit her aunt and
uncle at Châlons.”</p>

<p>By which Monsieur Bouchard, who
was no fool, found out three things:
first, that Madame Vernet had been
beforehand with the <i>concierge</i>; second,
that Madame Vernet did not have an
aunt and uncle at Châlons, although
she seemed to have uncles and aunts
in every town, village and hamlet in
France; and third, that wherever she
might be she certainly was not at
Châlons.</p>

<p>He spent the next three days in
vain efforts to find out Madame
Vernet’s whereabouts. The <i>concierge</i>
had evidently been thoroughly bought
and coached, and would absolutely tell
nothing. Madame Vernet had taken
her apartment by the month, and had
paid in advance. The <i>concierge</i> knew
no more. Not even a ten-franc piece
could screw any additional information
out of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Papa Bouchard began to feel a little
frightened. What would happen if it
should come out in the newspapers, as
Léontine had threatened? There were
journalists enough in Paris ready to
jump at such a story as Léontine had
hinted at. There was that Marsac,
and the remarkable tale he had concocted
about a bogus fortune—Papa
Bouchard recalled at least a dozen instances
that were frightfully like what
he apprehended. When this thought
occurred to him he bit the pillows in his
anguish—it was in the middle of one
of his sleepless nights. And what glee
would those laughing devils of newspaper
men have out of him! And
how should he ever show his face in
the Rue Clarisse? Monsieur Bouchard
made up his mind that if ever the thing
got into the newspapers he should emigrate
to Madagascar.</p>

<p>Of course, Pierre knew all about it.
Monsieur Bouchard had told him too
much not to tell him more. Pierre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
was only moderately sympathetic,
which infuriated Monsieur Bouchard.</p>

<p>“At least,” cried the poor gentleman,
“those two scamps, Léontine
and de Meneval, are in as much trouble
as I am.”</p>

<p>“But they have the necklace,” replied
Pierre, “and it seems to me that
Monsieur is in a jolly hole, with his
necklaces and his widows, and all the
rest of it.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard, at this, burst
into a string of bad words that were
very reprehensible, but perfectly natural
to a man in his imminent circumstances.</p>

<p>However Pierre might choose to
devil his master in private, in public he
was unflinchingly loyal to him. In the
first place, Léontine and de Meneval,
each determined to force an explanation
from Monsieur Bouchard, haunted
the Rue Bassano, and when they did
not come they wrote. It was easy
enough to dispose of the frantic notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
and letters, but when the two came—always
separately—and Léontine wept
and raved that she would and must see
Papa Bouchard, and de Meneval swore
and stormed to the same effect, Pierre
was immovable. Monsieur was one
day at Passy, another he was at Versailles,
always on important business,
and Pierre never had the least idea
when he would be home. Thus, by
unceasing vigilance and an unabashed
front, Pierre managed to stave off an
interview between his master and the
de Menevals for the whole of a critical
week.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard was easier
to manage. Pierre went to the Rue
Clarisse daily, with a very acceptable tale
about Monsieur Bouchard being so busy
making the will of a rich old gentleman
at Passy that he had no time for
anything else; likewise, that he was
finding the noise and commotion of the
Rue Bassano so objectionable that he
bitterly regretted having left the Rue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Clarisse. This little romance took so
well that Pierre improved on it by saying
that Monsieur Bouchard was trying
to sublet the apartment, so he could
return to peace and quiet in the Rue
Clarisse. Mademoiselle Bouchard was
touched, charmed, delighted to hear
this.</p>

<p>Not so Élise. She was not of a
trusting or confiding nature. When
Pierre turned up, late in the day,
yawning, and still only half-awake,
she did not believe in the least his
account of being kept awake by the
noises of the carts and carriages in
the Rue Bassano. She boldly taxed
him with leading a riotous life, which
Pierre strenuously denied, and going
to Mademoiselle Bouchard, actually
wept over Élise’s want of confidence
in him after thirty years of married
life. Mademoiselle sharply rebuked
Élise, and ordered her henceforth to
believe everything Pierre told her.
Élise made no reply to this beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
her usual sniff, but privately resolved
the first day she had time to slip
around to the Rue Bassano and interview
the <i>concierge</i>. She knew the ways
of <i>concierges</i> as well as the ways of men.</p>

<p>For four days Monsieur Bouchard
gave himself, body and bones, to the
business of a private detective in trying
to locate Madame Vernet. Vain
effort! He of course expected to
have to pay handsomely for the return
of the paste necklace, but he
valued his peace of mind more than
money, and was ready enough to
come down with some cash provided
he could get hold of the necklace.</p>

<p>On the fifth day he was delighted,
but scarcely surprised, to receive a
letter from Madame Vernet saying
that, as there seemed to be some
complications concerning the necklace
he had so generously and sweetly
given her, and as she was a person
of much delicacy of feeling, she was
seriously thinking of returning it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
could address her at the Pigeon House
at Melun.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard replied by writing
and flatly offering her five hundred
francs, nearly six times the original value
of the necklace. He himself took his
letter out to the Pigeon House, and
spent the entire evening there, on the
chance that Madame Vernet might
turn up. She did not, however.
Next day he received a letter from
her, all reproaches and hysterics; how
could he offer her money!—her,
the most disinterested, the most retiring
of her sex! Money was nothing
to her, least of all a trifling sum of five
hundred francs. Monsieur Bouchard
promptly replied, increasing his offer to
a thousand francs. Another deeply
injured note from Madame Vernet.
At last, after five days of continual
negotiation, Monsieur Bouchard haunting
the Pigeon House every evening,
terms were arranged—two thousand
francs in exchange for the necklace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>It was infamous, but as Pierre reminded
Monsieur Bouchard, one must
always pay for one’s indiscretions.
It would seem as if Madame Vernet
had the direct inspiration of Satan
himself in dealing with the too amiable
and too susceptible Monsieur Bouchard.
Not only had she given her address
all along as the Pigeon House, but
she appointed that abode of gaiety
and champagne as the rendezvous
where she was to meet Monsieur
Bouchard and hand over the necklace
in return for two thousand francs
in notes of the Bank of France—Madame
Vernet specified that there
should be no cheque in the affair; she
was so diffident; it always embarrassed
her to go to a bank, and notes could
be passed anywhere.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_198"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" alt="Élise had that evening found her opportunity
to go round to the Rue Bassano"></div>

<p>But Monsieur Bouchard was not
wholly without discretion. He concluded
he would rather not be seen in
the act of handing over the money to
Madame Vernet. Pierre—the foxy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Pierre—should give her the money
and should receive the necklace. So,
on the evening specified, the two took
the train for Melun, and went rattling
out of Paris without dreaming of what
was brewing behind
them and
likewise stewing
ahead of them.</p>

<p>It was simply
this: Élise had
that evening found
her opportunity to
go around to the
Rue Bassano, and
in five minutes she
had discovered
everything Monsieur
Bouchard and Pierre had been
doing since they left the Rue Clarisse.
The <i>concierge</i> knew all about the chase
after Madame Vernet, the continual
trotting out to Melun—nay, she knew
that both Pierre and his master had an
appointment with Madame Vernet at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the Pigeon House that very evening.
Élise returned, boiling with rage, to
the Rue Clarisse, and with face and
eyes blazing recounted to the trembling
and agitated Mademoiselle Bouchard
the horrid story of the frightful
goings on in the Rue Bassano. And
she had for audience not only poor
Mademoiselle Bouchard, but Léontine
de Meneval, who happened to be paying
her weekly visit to Rue Clarisse.
Léontine scarcely heard Élise’s fierce
denunciations of the two reprobates
in the Rue Bassano; all she really
took in was the correspondence and
the running to and fro about the necklace.
She flew from the apartment,
leaving Mademoiselle Bouchard in a
state of collapse on the sofa, while
Élise retailed every circumstance of
horror she had found out about the
renegades. Calling the first cab,
Léontine drove rapidly home, rushed
to her strong-box, and got the supposed
paste necklace out. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
said to Monsieur Bouchard that anybody
could tell at a glance that it was
an imitation, yet it so glowed and
sparkled in its white radiance that for
the first time she began to suspect it
was real. If so, it only deepened the
mystery, and she felt she must solve
it then and there. Again ordering a
cab, she sprang into it and ordered the
cabman to drive her to one of the
great jewelry shops in the Avenue
de l’Opéra. On reaching it she
ordered the carriage to wait, and going
into the shop, asked to see the proprietor.
He advanced, politely, and
Léontine, taking the necklace from
about her neck, where she wore it
under her high bodice, said, with such
calmness as she could muster:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_200">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="And drove rapidly home">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Will you kindly give me some idea
of the value of this?”</p>

<p>The jeweller took it up, examined it
for a moment, and said:</p>

<p>“About forty thousand francs, I
should say, Madame. The stones are
remarkably well matched, better than
in many costlier necklaces.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say the stones
are—are——”</p>

<p>“Well matched, Madame. In fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
some of them came from this establishment.
It was made by M. Leduc, a
friend of mine, and I assisted him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Léontine,
forcing herself to be calm, reclasping
the necklace round her throat and covering
it up. She went out, got into the
cab again, and hesitated before giving
her order. She was in truth quite
dazed and mystified. The man had
touched his hat three times, when she
said, with an air of quiet determination:</p>

<p>“To the St. Lazare station.”</p>

<p>Yes, she would that very moment
go and confess all to Victor. Her resolution
seemed an inspiration. There
was some mystery about the necklace,
and it was only fair that Victor should
know it. There should be no more
concealments between them. She
reached the station just in time to miss
the eight o’clock train. It was still
daylight, and she waited for the next—a
very slow one. Half-way to Melun
the engine broke down. It was nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
eleven o’clock before she found herself
in front of the huge old barrack building
in which de Meneval had his quarters.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_203">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_203.jpg" alt="In the middle of the room was spread a
table, with preparation for an elaborate
supper">
</figure>

<p>The orderly who took the place of
<i>concierge</i> at once recognized her and
politely escorted her to Captain de
Meneval’s door.</p>

<p>“I do not think Monsieur le Capitaine
is in at present,” he said; “but
if Madame will wait, he will no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
be here shortly.” And he knocked
loudly at the door.</p>

<p>It was opened by a soldier—de
Meneval’s servant—whom Léontine
had never seen before. The man’s
unfamiliar face, and the unlooked-for
sight that met her eyes as soon as she
stepped over the threshold, made her
turn as if to go out. In the middle of
the room was spread a table, with preparations
for an elaborate supper; and
Léontine’s quick eye discovered that
ladies were expected, for to three huge
bouquets were appended cards with
names written on them. “For the
Sprightly Aglaia,” “For Olga, the
Queen of the Dance;” “For Louise
of the Fairy Foot.”</p>

<p>Léontine, slightly embarrassed, said
to the soldier:</p>

<p>“I see I have made a mistake. I
am Madame de Meneval, and I supposed
these to be Captain de Meneval’s
quarters, but evidently they are
not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“They are, Madame,” replied the
man, very civilly.</p>

<p>“But I say they are <i>not</i>!” replied
Léontine, somewhat tartly. “Captain
de Meneval <i>never</i> entertains ladies at
supper. He leads a most retired life at
Melun, while here are preparations
made for a gay party.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Madame; but Monsieur le
Capitaine is giving the party to some
young ladies from the Pigeon House.”</p>

<p>Léontine’s first impulse was to box
the soldier’s ears, but in sweeping
another glance round the room she
recognized her own picture over the
mantel, together with a battered photograph
of de Meneval’s chum, Major
Fallière, and other things to convince
her that Captain de Meneval was really
the host of the impending supper party.
She retained self-possession enough to
say to the man:</p>

<p>“If you have finished you may go.”
And he discreetly vanished.</p>

<p>Léontine, throwing her parasol on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
sofa, began to march up and down the
room in wrath and excitement.</p>

<p>“<i>These</i> are his quiet evenings! <i>He</i>
doesn’t know anything about the
Pigeon House since he was married!
I shouldn’t have minded it if he had
told me all about it, but to pretend to
such economies, and at the same time
be secretly indulging in these extravagances—these
shameless orgies—oh,
it is too much!”</p>

<p>Léontine had completely forgotten
Putzki and Louise and the object of
her sudden descent on her husband.
While she was walking up and down,
becoming every moment more angry
and wrought up, the door opened, and
in walked Major Fallière. Léontine
recognized him at once from his picture—a
soldierly looking man, slightly
bald, immaculately well dressed, and
bearing in his air the reason for his sobriquet,
the Pink of Military Propriety.
But his eye was not unkind; on the
contrary, he was distinctly in the class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
of men designated by women as dear
old things; and as such Léontine felt
an instant confidence in him.</p>

<p>The correct Major was not so correct,
however, that he hesitated to
march up to Léontine, and chucking
her playfully under the chin, remarked:</p>

<p>“The Pigeons are out early to-night.
Where are the rest of the Pouters?”</p>

<p>Léontine’s face was a study. A
flash of rage from her bright eyes was
succeeded by a look of puzzled helplessness,
and then a radiant smile of delight.
This was really too good. He—old
P. M. P.—had mistaken her,
Léontine de Meneval, for one of the
young ladies from the Pigeon House!
Angry as she was, she could not forbear
laughing, and she replied, with her
sauciest air:</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll be here presently. I
came early because I had a premonition
that old P. M. P. would be here early,
too. Always on time—one of the
cardinal virtues of a soldier.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
then Satan tempted her to tiptoe and
actually chuck old P. M. P. under the
chin!</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_208"><img src="images/i_208.jpg" alt="To tiptoe and actually chuck old P. M. P.
under the chin"></div>

<p>The effect frightened her for a moment
or two, because Major Fallière,
perfectly astounded and
highly offended, drew
himself up stiffly and
glared at her like
an ogre. But she
was so very pretty,
her impertinence
was accompanied
with such a charming
air of simplicity,
that no man
not an absolute
ogre could
withstand it.
So, in spite of himself, old P. M. P.’s
backbone relaxed, his eyes softened
and he tugged at his mustache to disguise
the smile that <i>would</i> persist in
coming.</p>

<p>Léontine having once admitted Satan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
into her heart, he speedily took complete
possession of the premises, and
the next thing he inspired her to do
was to examine the prim Major carefully
from the top of his thinly thatched
head down to the tips of his well-fitting
shoes, and say to him:</p>

<p>“I have often heard of you, and I
am so glad to meet you. You know
you are quite a handsome man, Major.”</p>

<p>The Major grinned.</p>

<p>“For your age, that is.”</p>

<p>The Major scowled.</p>

<p>“And I like you well enough to
wish to make friends with you. But
first I must tell you my name. It is
Satanita.”</p>

<p>“Satanita! Rather suggestive, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should say so. Little Satan; and
I match my name.”</p>

<p>“You are the sweetest, most innocent
and captivating little devil I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. You should see me
dance and hear me sing. The Pouters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
as you call them, are not a patch on
me.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe it.”</p>

<p>“I have another name—I am
called the Queen of the Harem-Scarem.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you are.”</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Léontine, seating
herself with a confidential air beside
Major Fallière, “what do you think of
our host, Victor de Meneval?”</p>

<p>“One of the best fellows in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Devoted to his wife, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have never seen her, but
I hear she is a charming creature, and
Victor is truly attached to her.”</p>

<p>“This looks like it, doesn’t it?”
cried Léontine, pointing to the supper
table.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it doesn’t look like
it. I happen to know that de Meneval
has had a good deal to trouble him
lately. He got some money from an
unexpected source some days ago, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
I advised him to give a little supper—it’s
dull out here, you know——”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> advised him to give a little
supper! You—the Pink of Military
Propriety!”</p>

<p>“Yes, why not?”</p>

<p>“And how about his wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the Major, with easy
confidence, “she would probably make
an awful row if she knew it—but
she’ll never know it. De Meneval has
coached me—I know exactly what to
tell Léontine when I meet her—it so
happens that I have not met her yet.
But I hear she is a charming young
woman.”</p>

<p>“She will be twice as charming to
you when she finds that you have been
leading her husband off into giving
suppers to—to—little devils like me
for example,” said Léontine, very
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Oh, de Meneval and I have mapped
out our campaign. We have a large
and trusty assortment of lies, expressly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
for Léontine’s consumption, and she
will swallow every one of them.”</p>

<p>Now, this was very provoking of
the Major, but something in his kind
eyes, his way of standing up for Victor,
his candid praise of herself, gave
Léontine a sudden impulse to tell him the
whole story of what was weighing on
her and perplexing her and had driven
her out to Melun at that hour of the
night. She knew all about him, what
a generous, sympathetic fellow he was,
in spite of his primness and propriety—in
short, that he was a dear old
thing. So, with eyes flashing with
mischief, and with smiles dimpling her
fair face, Léontine said, demurely:</p>

<p>“I have still another name besides
Satanita and Queen of the Harem-Scarem.
Can’t you guess it?”</p>

<p>“No. I am not a clairvoyant.”</p>

<p>“I am—” Léontine rose, with her
whole face sparkling with impish delight—“I
am Léontine, Madame de Meneval,
wife of your friend, Victor de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Meneval. Yonder is my picture.
Here am I.”</p>

<p>Poor P. M. P! He stared at her
for a full minute, glared wildly about
him, and then, jumping up, made a
dash for the door, from which Léontine,
laughing till the tears ran down
her cheeks, dragged him back.</p>

<p>“What are you running away for?”
she asked, forcing him to a seat beside
her.</p>

<p>“Because—because—” the Major
tore his hair, “oh, de Meneval will
certainly shoot me when he hears that
I chucked you under the chin!”</p>

<p>“But he won’t hear it, unless you
tell him. And <i>I</i> chucked <i>you</i> under
the chin, remember.”</p>

<p>Major Fallière, burying his head in
his hands, groaned aloud, and then
all at once the absurdity of the thing
struck him, and he burst into a howl
of laughter.</p>

<p>Léontine joined him. They laughed
and laughed, and when they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
get a little quiet Léontine would motion
as if to chuck him under the chin
again, and Fallière would go off into
renewed spasms.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_214">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_214.jpg" alt="Léontine would motion as if to chuck him
under the chin">
</figure>

<p>Presently, however, Léontine grew
grave. The instant success of her impromptu
personation had given her an
idea. She wanted revenge—a sharp
revenge—on de Meneval, and she saw
a way to get it.</p>

<p>“Listen, and be quiet,” she said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Fallière. “Victor deserves to be
punished. I will tell you why. He
has always represented to me that he
led the quietest kind of a life here—nothing
but attention to his military
duties, and his evenings spent in the
seclusion of his own room, with nothing
but ballistics and my picture for
company.”</p>

<p>Fallière could not refrain from a
soft whistle.</p>

<p>“And he professed to be so glad
that you were ordered to Melun, because
you were so much more sedate
than the other officers. He complained
that they spend too much
time at the Pigeon House, while he
had entirely given up frequenting that
fascinating place.”</p>

<p>Fallière whistled a little louder.</p>

<p>“I had the greatest difficulty in
persuading him to take me to supper
there the other night. Now, what do
I find? That he has been throwing
sand into my eyes all the time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Look!” Léontine waved her arms dramatically
toward the table. “Oughtn’t
he to be punished?”</p>

<p>“Certainly he ought,” replied Fallière,
with the ready acquiescence of
a bachelor who thinks that married
men should be made to toe the line.</p>

<p>“Very well. You will help me?”</p>

<p>“You may count on me.”</p>

<p>Léontine rose and looked around
her. On the sideboard sat a couple of
bottles of mineral water, and on the
floor near by a wine cooler full of bottles
of champagne. She cleverly transferred
the labels from two of the
champagne bottles to the apollinaris
bottles and then put them in the wine
cooler.</p>

<p>“I think I can drink at least a quart
of apollinaris,” she said.</p>

<p>“And I’ll see that you get apollinaris
every time,” replied that crafty
villain of a Fallière, laughing.</p>

<p>“And I’m Satanita, and I shall act
Satanita until I have made Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
sorry enough he ever played me any
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t! At the first
sign of distress on his part you will
throw the whole business to the winds,
fall on his neck and implore his forgiveness.
I know women well.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do—having never
been married. But wait and see if I
don’t give him a bad quarter of an
hour. And I reckon on your assistance.”</p>

<p>“I will stand by you to the last.”</p>

<p>They were interrupted at this point
by a great sound of scuffling outside
the door, mingled with shrieks of girlish
laughter. The door flew open,
revealing three remarkably pretty
girls—Aglaia, Olga and Louise—dragging
in an elderly gentleman by
main force and his coat tails. The
elderly gentleman was resisting mildly
but with no great vigor, and it was
plain he was not particularly averse
to the roguish company in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
found himself. And the elderly gentleman
was—Papa Bouchard!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_218">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_218.jpg" alt="Dragging in an elderly gentleman by main

</figure>

<p>One of these merry imps from the
Pigeon House had possessed herself of
his hat, which she had stuck on her
curly head; another one had laid violent
hands on his umbrella, while the
third and sauciest of the lot, Aglaia,
had robbed him of his spectacles,
which she wore on her tiptilted nose.
Papa Bouchard, puffing, protesting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
frightened, but laughing in spite of
himself, was saying:</p>

<p>“Young ladies, young ladies, I
really cannot remain, as you insist, to
supper. I do not even know the name
of the host on this occasion. I am
quite unused to these orgies. I am
out here this evening with my servant
merely for the purpose of completing a
business transaction.”</p>

<p>A chorus of “Ohs!” and “Ahs!”
saluted this speech, and Mademoiselle
Aglaia, Papa Bouchard’s chief tormentor,
asked, solemnly:</p>

<p>“Is your business engagement with
a lady or a gentleman?”</p>

<p>And when Papa Bouchard, in the
innocence of his soul, replied, “It is
with a lady,” each one of the Pouters,
as the young ladies of the Pigeon
House were called, pretended to fall
over in a dead faint.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, much alarmed, ran
from one to the other, trying to revive
them; but while he was rubbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the brow and slapping the hands of
each in turn, Louise suddenly came to
life, and running and locking the door,
put the key into her pocket, so that
Papa Bouchard had no means of escape
except out of the third-story window
or up the chimney.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_220">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_220.jpg" alt="Papa Bouchard, much alarmed, ran from
one to the other">
</figure>

<p>And at that moment his eye fell on
Léontine.</p>

<p>Pity Papa Bouchard! He really
had no intention of attending so gay
a party. He had spent the whole evening
anxiously watching for Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Vernet. She had not arrived, or at
least had not seen fit to reveal herself,
and while he was hovering about the
entrance to the terrace garden looking
for her, these three merry girls had
come along, had swooped down on him
without the least warning, and had carried
him off bodily to de Meneval’s
supper. Papa Bouchard had not the
slightest idea of where he was when he
was plumped down in Captain de
Meneval’s room. But one look around
him—the sight of Léontine—revealed
his whole dreadful predicament to him.
It was too much for poor Papa
Bouchard!</p>

<p>His persecutors having permitted
him to sit on a chair, he endeavored
to recover himself, and fanning with
his handkerchief in great agitation,
he debated with himself what to do.
Léontine, meanwhile, was laughing at
him without a sign of recognition.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, presently finding his
voice, said sternly to Léontine:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“May I ask what you are doing
here in this company?”</p>

<p>To which Léontine, with pert gaiety,
replied:</p>

<p>“And may I ask what <i>you</i> are doing
here in this company?”</p>

<p>“I,” said Papa Bouchard, with dignity,
“am here by accident, and by the
violence of these young women.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fib!” cried Olga.
“The old duffer begged us to let him
come. We tried to shake him off, but
we couldn’t. Isn’t that so, Aglaia
and Louise?”</p>

<p>And Aglaia and Louise said it was
so.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, astounded at such
duplicity, glared at them, but the only
satisfaction he got was a fillip on the
nose from Aglaia and a remark to the
effect that he and the truth didn’t live
at the same address. Papa Bouchard
indignantly turned his back on these
traducers and again opened on Léontine.</p>

<p>“I am amazed—amazed at your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
temerity. What shall I say to Captain
de Meneval when I see him, as I
shall to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“Anything you like,” was Léontine’s
laughing answer.</p>

<p>“Léontine de Meneval,” cried Papa
Bouchard, much enraged, “do you
know <i>me</i>, your guardian and trustee?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” responded Léontine,
nonchalantly. “I never saw you before.”</p>

<p>At this, shouts of laughter came
from the three young ladies, and they
all urged Papa Bouchard to stop his
wild career of prevarication and learn
to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, quite beside himself,
turned to Major Fallière.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, solemnly, “you wear
the uniform of an officer, and I presume
you are a gentleman. Believe
me, this lady—” indicating Léontine—“is
the wife of a brother officer of
yours, Captain de Meneval. The
truest kindness you can do him or her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
is to persuade her to leave this scene
of dissipation and return to Paris
with me.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_224">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_224.jpg" alt="“O-o-o-oh!” shrieked the three impish
girls in chorus, “what an outrageous
proposition!”">
</figure>

<p>“O-o-o-o-h!” shrieked the three
impish girls in chorus. “What an
outrageous proposition! And she says
she never saw the man before!”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, still appealing to
Major Fallière, continued, earnestly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps this misguided girl has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
told you that she is Madame Victor de
Meneval.”</p>

<p>“She told me,” quietly replied Major
Fallière, “that she was simply Satanita,
a singer and dancer.”</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard dropped limply on
the sofa and groaned in anguish of
heart. But now was heard a jaunty
step on the stair, which all recognized
as de Meneval’s. The mischievous
Aglaia ran forward and unlocked the
door, and in stepped de Meneval,
smiling and debonair.</p>

<p>Now, this little festivity had been
his sole recreation during the ten miserable
days since he had got into the
complication of the necklace; and the
supper, which was for only five, was at
the suggestion of the Pink of Military
Propriety. So it was without any compunctions
that de Meneval walked into
his quarters, expecting to find a small
but jolly party. But he instantly
recognized the two uninvited members,
and stopping short on the carpet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
his ruddy complexion turned a sickly
green.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_226">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_226.jpg" alt="His ruddy complexion turned a sickly

</figure>

<p>Papa Bouchard felt a sensation of
triumph at Captain de Meneval’s entrance.
<i>He</i>, at least, would not dare to
deride and defy him, as these wretched
young women had done. But before
Monsieur Bouchard could open his
mouth, Aglaia burst forth, pointing to
the old gentleman:</p>

<p>“Of all the impudent men I ever
saw, this one excels! What do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
think? As soon as he found we were
coming here to supper, he hung on to
us—declared there was nothing he
liked so well as a gay little party, that
he could drink so much champagne he
was called the Champagne Tank—and
actually forced himself in here, although
we tried to push him out. Didn’t he,
Olga and Louise?”</p>

<p>And Olga and Louise confirmed
every word that Aglaia uttered.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, thoroughly exasperated,
struck an attitude like that
of Socrates in his favorite picture,
“Socrates and His Pupils,” and addressed
Captain de Meneval.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Capitaine,” he said,
“you of course do not and cannot
believe a word that these young ladies
say concerning my presence here to-night.”</p>

<p>Victor, very much alarmed, and
dreading to catch Léontine’s eye, yet
retained enough of his wits to see that
he had Papa Bouchard at a disadvantage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and that the best thing to do was
to assume the worst, and decline to
listen to any explanation.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Bouchard,” he said,
coldly, “you are asking a little too
much of me when you wish me to
believe your testimony against that
of three ladies. I don’t know how
you came, but I am very glad to see
you now that you are here, and hope
you will remain to supper.”</p>

<p>“But I came on business!” cried
poor Papa Bouchard. “I had an appointment
to finish up a transaction
with a lady——”</p>

<p>And Aglaia and Louise and Olga
again uttered a chorus of shrieks, and
pretended to faint.</p>

<p>But de Meneval had troubles of his
own to attend to then. He walked
over to where Léontine sat, and assuming
an air of forced jollity, such as a
man puts on when he anticipates a
wigging from the wife of his bosom,
said:</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_230"><img src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="She sang"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Delighted you happened to arrive,
my love—and what do you think of
the Pouters?”</p>

<p>“I think they are very jolly girls,”
promptly replied Léontine; “but as I
am another uninvited guest, I thought
it best to tell Major Fallière and the
others that I, too, am a singer and
dancer—Satanita, I called myself, on
the spur of the moment.”</p>

<p>De Meneval turned from green to
blue. “And you did not immediately
inform them that you are my wife?”
he hissed, in a savage whisper.</p>

<p>“No,” coolly replied Léontine, “and
when Papa Bouchard recognized me,
I declared I had never seen him before.
I am little Satanita—good name,
isn’t it?—for this evening.”</p>

<p>De Meneval, enraged and disconcerted
beyond words, felt helpless.
Suppose he were to proclaim the
truth? Léontine, as if answering the
thought in his mind, whispered, with
cruel glee:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“And if you say I am your wife I
shall simply deny it. Satanita I am
and Satanita I shall be, and I shall
live up to the part—of that you may
be sure.”</p>

<p>De Meneval was in doubt whether
to shoot himself. And
then there was a move
toward the table. The
girls were dragging Papa
Bouchard forward, who,
still very angry, was yet
not insensible to their
pretty and mischievous
wiles. Léontine, running
up to Major Fallière,
demanded that he
sit next her at table, while de Meneval
found himself sitting opposite Léontine,
and with indescribable feelings
saw her drink champagne, as he supposed,
by the tumblerful. Fallière had
cleverly got hold of the two bottles of
apollinaris, and filled Léontine’s glass
with the greatest assiduity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span></p>

<div class="figright" id="i_231"><img src="images/i_231.jpg" alt="she even danced"></div>

<p>There was much noise and excitement,
and as the supper progressed
de Meneval grew almost
frantic over the
spectacle his dear little
Léontine was making
of herself. For she
not only managed to
drink innumerable
glasses of apollinaris,
but she sang, she even
danced. She paraded
up and down the room,
singing, in her sweet,
saucy voice, verses made up at the
moment.</p>

<div class="verse">Moët-et-Chandon are my span.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She paused for reflection and added:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And when Moët and Chandon go lame,</div>
<div class="verse">I drive Mumm and Roederer!”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Here her invention gave out, and
rubbing the top of de Meneval’s head
with one of the champagne bottles,
she added, laughing:</p>

<p>“Houp-là!”</p>

<p>That “Houp-là” almost drove de
Meneval to distraction, but a roar of
applause, in which all joined except
her husband and Papa Bouchard, encouraged
Léontine to continue. After
a few moments’ reflection she began
singing again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“This is the way in Champagne Land!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, Champagne Land is dear to me,</div>
<div class="verse">But Champagne Land is queer to me.</div>
<div class="indent">There, lobsters grow on trees,</div>
<div class="indent">There is a mine of cheese;</div>
<div class="indent2">The oysters walk,</div>
<div class="indent2">The cocktails talk,</div>
<div class="verse">And the <i>pâté de foie gras</i> builds his nest</div>
<div class="verse">In the hedge where the anchovy paste grows best.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And she concluded with another
“Houp-là!”</p>

<p>At this Papa Bouchard, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
been as much horrified as de Meneval,
leaned over and whispered in
agony to him:</p>

<p>“She has certainly lost her mind
and appears quite crazy!”</p>

<p>This was too much for poor de
Meneval. He had spent an hour of
torture while Léontine, vastly to her
own amusement, to Major Fallière’s,
and to that of the Pouters, had exhibited
all the saucy graces of a Satanita,
and Queen of the Harem-Scarem,
but de Meneval could stand no more.
Therefore, rising from the table, he
cried, with tears in his eyes:</p>

<p>“My friends, I beg of you to leave
me. This lady who calls herself Satanita
is my wife. I have never seen
her act in this manner before—I am
sure she never so acted before. It is
my duty as well as my privilege to
shield her, and I wish to say that if
any person, man or woman, ever mentions
what her unfortunate conduct
to-night has been, a life will be forfeited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
for I swear to shoot any man
who dares to breathe one word against
her, and any woman who does it may
reckon on my vengeance.” And with
big tears rolling down his cheeks, he
held his arms out to his
wife.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_234"><img src="images/i_234.jpg" alt="I am your own true, devoted Léontine"></div>

<p>This was too much for
Léontine. Just as Major
Fallière had predicted, at
the first sign of repentance
on de Meneval’s
part she forgot all her
resolutions to punish him,
and falling into his arms,
she exclaimed, in her own,
natural voice:</p>

<p>“You dear, chivalrous
angel, I haven’t touched
champagne—it is nothing but apollinaris
water, and I am your own true,
devoted Léontine!”</p>

<p>De Meneval was so overcome that
he could do nothing but pat her head
and cry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Oh, what have you not made me
suffer to-night!”</p>

<p>“At least,” replied Léontine, laughing and
looking toward Major Fallière,
“you have not spent your usual
dull evening at Melun,” and de Meneval
had the grace to blush, while old
P. M. P. laughed back at the roguish
Léontine.</p>

<p>Papa Bouchard, too, had suffered
agonies at Léontine’s behavior—agonies,
however, which the attentions he
experienced at the hands of the young
ladies partly ameliorated, for they had
not stopped pinching and tickling him
for a single moment.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “I have been very
much agitated and distressed—I never
saw such doings in the Rue Clarisse.
I was very seriously concerned at my
ward’s behavior—very seriously concerned.
But now,” continued Papa
Bouchard, “everything seems to be
straightened out to everybody’s satisfaction,
and finding ourselves accidentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
together, why not finish up our evening
with a jollity which—er—did not—er—exist,
so far as I am concerned, in
the beginning? So I say—houp-là!”</p>

<p>Alas! at that very moment the
door opened softly behind him and in
walked Madame Vernet! She was
prettier, more demure and gentle
than ever before. Her black costume,
though highly coquettish, had a nun-like
propriety about it. She advanced
with downcast eyes, and said,
timidly:</p>

<p>“I knocked and thought I heard
someone say, ‘Come in.’ I do not
know on whose hospitality I am trespassing,
but I saw Monsieur Bouchard
enter half an hour ago, and as I must
see him on a matter of business, I
venture to ask for a word with him
here.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard, at the sight of
her, seemed about to collapse. Not so
Captain de Meneval. He rose at
and said, with an ironical bow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Madame Vernet, you are trespassing
on the hospitality of Captain de
Meneval, the gentleman you adopted
as a brother about ten days ago and
handed over as a dangerous lunatic to
Dr. Delcasse—who had a strait-jacket,
a cold douche and a padded cell ready
for him.”</p>

<p>At this Madame Vernet assumed an
attitude more shrinking, more timid
than before, and falling on Monsieur
Bouchard’s shoulder, cried:</p>

<p>“Dear Paul, protect me from this
dreadful person!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard was not at that
moment able to protect anybody. He
looked the picture of abject despair
as he clutched the arms of his chair.
He could only say, feebly:</p>

<p>“Go away! go away!”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you speak to your
own Adèle!” cried Madame Vernet,
burying her head on Monsieur Bouchard’s
reluctant bosom and bursting
into tears. “Oh, what a change within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
one short week! Last week it was
nothing but ‘Dearest Adèle, when
will you name the day?’ And now
it is ‘Go away! go away!’” Madame
Vernet’s voice was lost in sobs,
but she continued to rub her left ear
vigorously into Monsieur Bouchard’s
shirt front.</p>

<p>“It is false!” wailed Monsieur Bouchard,
trying to escape from Madame
Vernet’s left ear.</p>

<p>“Do you pretend to deny,” sobbed
that timid and trustful creature, “that
only a week ago you gave me this?”
She took from her pocket the paste
necklace, and at the sight of it a shock
like a galvanic battery ran down the
backbones of de Meneval and Léontine.
“And that when I found it to
be paste you offered me two thousand
francs, in humble apology for the attempt
to deceive me?”</p>

<p>“It is false!” again cried Monsieur
Bouchard, almost weeping.</p>

<p>“And that we were to meet here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
to-night in order to make exchange?
Oh, dearest Paul, we have had lovers’
quarrels before, but nothing like this!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard was too much
overcome by Madame Vernet’s affectionate
attentions to do more than
groan and try to push her away. But
de Meneval, walking coolly up to her,
quietly and very unexpectedly took the
necklace out of her hand, saying:</p>

<p>“This is the property of my wife,
and as such I take possession of it,
and call on Monsieur Bouchard to
make an explanation.”</p>

<p>At this Madame Vernet uttered a
despairing shriek, and throwing both
arms round Monsieur Bouchard’s neck,
screamed:</p>

<p>“You must avenge this insult, Paul!
And you must at least give me the
two thousand francs!”</p>

<p>But Monsieur Bouchard was so perfectly
delighted with the notion that de
Meneval had the necklace and Pierre
the two thousand francs, that his countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
changed as if by magic. He
struggled to his feet, and after vainly
to disengage himself from Madame
Vernet’s encircling arms, much to the
amusement of the three young ladies
and Major Fallière, cried:</p>

<p>“I am perfectly overjoyed to make
an explanation—an explanation that
will cause you, Léontine, and you, de
Meneval, to forget all the unpleasant
events of this evening. This necklace
is paste—and the one Léontine has is
real. You may remember, de Meneval,
you came to my apartment a week
ago last Monday evening, bringing
Léontine’s real diamond necklace with
you. You told me that when you
bought it for her you also bought an
imitation one for seventy-five francs,
which you kept a secret from her.”</p>

<p>De Meneval, during this speech,
had lost his dashing and determined
attitude.</p>

<p>“I believe I did something of the
kind,” he said, meekly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“And that you had, still unknown
to Léontine, put the paste one in place
of the real one; and you threatened, if
I did not advance money to pay a large
bill you owed at the Pigeon House for
things like this—” Monsieur Bouchard
indicated the supper table and the
guests with one wave of his arm—“you
would take the necklace to the
pawnbroker.”</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_242"><img src="images/i_242.jpg" alt="The door was burst open and in rushed
Pierre, pale and breathless"></div>

<p>De Meneval turned to Léontine,
and knowing what was coming, said,
with a sickly smile:</p>

<p>“Dearest, will you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will!” replied Léontine,
who knew more of what was coming
than did de Meneval.</p>

<p>“Scarcely were you gone,” continued
Monsieur Bouchard, assuming
his oracular manner, which sat rather
awkwardly on him, as Madame Vernet
persisted in nestling on his shoulder,
“when in comes Léontine with
the paste necklace, and for the same
purpose—money or the pawnbroker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
It at once occurred to me that she
could not be trusted with any necklace
on which she thought money could be
raised—her debts were to tailors and
dressmakers—so I gave her back her
own necklace—she
has it now—and
told her it
was paste, and
she said it looked
it. Then, just
as I had got rid
of her, in comes
<i>this</i> lady—”
Papa Bouchard
made a desperate
effort to shake off
Madame Vernet,
but that diffident person only held on to
him the more affectionately—“picked
up the necklace, clasped it round her
neck, and walked off with it, and I have
spent the most miserable week of my
life trying to get it back. I had
arranged to give her the two thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
francs, which Pierre, my man, has in his
pocket at this moment, when, owing to
this lady’s indelicate persistence in following
me here, and in rashly exposing
the necklace, she lost it, and I keep
my two thousand francs. If I could
find that rascal Pierre I could prove all
I say.”</p>

<p>And as if in answer to his name, the
door was burst open, and in rushed
Pierre, pale and breathless.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he cried to Papa Bouchard;
“all is discovered, and we are
in the greatest danger. My wife Élise
found out everything from the <i>concierge</i>
in the Rue Bassano this evening. She
went back to Mademoiselle Bouchard,
and, if you please, both of them took
the train for Melun to capture us—and
just as I was coming to warn you
I ran into them at the foot of the
stairs. They had asked for Captain de
Meneval’s quarters, in order to get him
to help them search for us. They are
on the stairs now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_244">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_244.jpg" alt="With much discretion, ranged themselves
primly on a sofa">
</figure>

<p>Léontine and de Meneval, meaning
to let Monsieur Bouchard bear alone
the brunt of Mademoiselle Bouchard’s
wrath, immediately scuttled into seats
against the wall, which they occupied
with great dignity. Major Fallière,
who had heard of Mademoiselle Bouchard,
got as far away from the girls as
he could, and they—Aglaia, Olga and
Louise—with much discretion ranged
themselves primly on a sofa at the
farthest end of the room. But this left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Papa Bouchard standing in the middle,
with Madame Vernet embracing him
tenderly. He, too, would have liked
to flee, but he was literally frozen
with terror, and unable to move or
speak. And then the door came open,
and in walked, or rather marched,
Mademoiselle Céleste Bouchard and
Élise.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_246"><img src="images/i_246.jpg" alt="Paul, stop those shocking demonstrations"></div>

<p>Never in all his fifty-four years of
life had Monsieur Bouchard seen his
sister in such a state as she was at that
moment. Her eyes sparkled, and her
small figure was erect and commanding.
Her emotions had made both her and
Élise altogether forget the primness
and propriety of their costumes, for
which mistress and maid had been
noted. Mademoiselle Bouchard’s correct,
elderly bonnet seemed to have
caught the same infection of demoralization
as Monsieur Bouchard, Pierre
and Pierrot, for it sat at a most improper
and dissipated angle. Her
mantle was awry, she had on one white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
glove and one black one, and a fringe
of white petticoat showed the agitation
in which she had dressed.</p>

<p>Élise was in somewhat the same condition,
and she clutched a flower pot and
a gold-headed stick which had belonged
to Bouchard <i>père</i>, under the impression
they were a travelling bag
and an umbrella.</p>

<p>The sight that met their
eyes was Monsieur Bouchard
apparently submitting
with willingness to Madame
Vernet’s endearments, while
the lady herself sobbed out
upon his breast:</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul, dearest, protect
your own Adèle from
that dreadful old woman!”</p>

<p>Now, this was too much for any woman
to stand. Mademoiselle Bouchard,
panting and trembling with wrath and
horror, sank into a chair.</p>

<p>“Élise,” she gasped, putting her hand
before her eyes, “put up your umbrella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
between me and that disgraceful sight.
I cannot look upon it.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_247">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="She clutched a flower pot and a gold-headed
stick">
</figure>

<p>Élise, equally agitated, made futile
attempts to convert the stick into an
umbrella, and then cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, this is only a stick! Perhaps
I put the umbrella in the travelling bag.”
But failing to find an umbrella in the
flower pot, she collapsed into a chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
next her mistress, crying out: “When
you, Mademoiselle, have finished with
Monsieur Bouchard I’ll dispose of Pierre.
Oh, the rascal!”</p>

<p>Pierre, like his master, was dumb
before the accuser. Not so Madame
Vernet. She continued to appeal to
Monsieur Bouchard:</p>

<p>“Oh, darling Paul, I am <i>so</i> frightened!
Why don’t you send her away?”</p>

<p>“But I am not your ‘darling Paul’
and never was!”</p>

<p>Poor Monsieur Bouchard was simply
a pitiable sight, and the de Menevals,
the Major and three girls were heartless
enough to go into convulsions
of silent mirth at his predicament.
They, too, had nothing to say in Mademoiselle
Bouchard’s indignant presence.
But that lady was determined to be
answered.</p>

<p>“Paul,” she said, in the tone of an
inquisitor, “stop those shocking demonstrations
toward that person and explain
your conduct to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“My dear Céleste,” replied Papa
Bouchard, in a faint voice and almost
weeping, “if you could induce this lady
to stop <i>her</i> demonstrations I should be
the happiest man on earth. And there’s
no explanation to give. I’m the helpless
victim of a designing woman.”</p>

<p>At which Madame Vernet screamed
and said, trying to kiss him:</p>

<p>“But I will forgive you, my own
Paul. I know you don’t mean what
you say.”</p>

<p>And Élise added to Monsieur Bouchard’s
anguish, and to Mademoiselle
Bouchard’s horror by crying out,
“Mademoiselle, he isn’t trying to get
rid of her. He is tickling her and
pinching her—I see him myself!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard thought he
should have died of horror at this awful
and baseless charge.</p>

<p>Apparently Madame Vernet was
master of the situation, but Major Fallière,
the cool, the resolute Fallière,
came to the rescue. Going up quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
to Madame Vernet, he deliberately
raised her face so he could look her
squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>“Madame Vernet,” he said, “you
seem to have lost sight of that little incident
of representing my friend, Captain
de Meneval, as your brother and a dangerous
lunatic, and the trick you played on
Dr. Delcasse. Now, I happen to know
that Dr. Delcasse is determined to punish
you, if he can find you, and unless you
immediately leave these quarters and
leave Melun I shall inform Dr. Delcasse
of your whereabouts, and you will
have a visit from the police.”</p>

<p>Madame Vernet, seeing she had met
her match, disengaged herself from Monsieur
Bouchard, to that gentleman’s great
joy. Assuming an attitude and air of
great innocence, she said:</p>

<p>“I don’t really understand what you
mean, or even who you are. But being
naturally a very diffident and retiring
person, I cannot stand the least unfavorable
criticism, and I shall certainly leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
this censorious and unsympathetic company.”</p>

<p>Major Fallière ceremoniously offered
her his arm, escorted her to the
door, and opened
it. Madame Vernet
paused on the
threshold.</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_251"><img src="images/i_251.jpg" alt="Major Fallière ceremoniously offered her
his arm"></div>

<p>“I go,” she said,
“to seek refuge
and protection with
my aunt and uncle
in Mézières.”</p>

<p>And the Major
shut the door after
her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle
Bouchard then rose
majestically and advanced to Monsieur
Bouchard.</p>

<p>“And <i>you</i>, Paul,” she said, “will seek
refuge and protection in the house of
your sister in the Rue Clarisse, where
you spent thirty happy and peaceful
years. You will there resume the orderly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and quiet life interrupted by your unfortunate
excursion into the Rue Bassano.
You will return to early hours and
wholesome meals. You will have boiled
mutton and rice, with a small glass of
claret, for your dinner, and ten o’clock
will be your hour for retiring. An
occasional visit to a picture gallery or a
museum will supply you with amusements
far more intellectual than the
orgies you have been indulging in at the
Pigeon House.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bouchard, the image of
despair, looked round him. Captain de
Meneval and Léontine were in fits of
laughter. The three girls, huddled together
on the sofa, were tittering; the
grim Major was smiling broadly. Even
a worm will turn, and so did Monsieur
Bouchard.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my dear Céleste,” he
said, in a voice he vainly endeavored to
make cool and debonair, “but what you
suggest is impossible. I have taken my
apartment for a year. And I find that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
boiled mutton and rice for dinner do not
suit my constitution. I—I—I—shall
remain in the Rue Bassano.”</p>

<p>A round of applause from Major Fallière,
Léontine and Victor, in which the
three young ladies joined, much to
Monsieur Bouchard’s annoyance, greeted
this. Nevertheless, it stiffened his backbone.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you do
not intend to return to the Rue Clarisse?”
asked Mademoiselle Bouchard,
in much agitation.</p>

<p>“Y—yes,” replied Monsieur Bouchard,
trying to assume a swashbuckler
air. “You see, I don’t think
the air of the Rue Clarisse agrees
with me very well. I often had
twinges of rheumatism there. Now,
since I have been in the Rue Bassano,
my joints feel about twenty-five years
younger. In fact, I myself feel considerably
younger—an increased vitality,
so to speak. I am sorry to
disoblige you, my dear Céleste, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
for the sake of my health and other
reasons I shall remain in my present
quarters.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard, defeated,
was speechless. Not so Élise. Walking
up to Pierre, she seized him and
bawled:</p>

<p>“No excuses about your health
shall keep <i>you</i> from the Rue Clarisse.
I promise you that you shall have a
very different time there from your
life in the Rue Bassano, turning night
into day, running out here to the
Pigeon House all the time and making
a show and a scandal of yourself.”</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_255"><img src="images/i_255.jpg" alt="Folding his arms and turning up the
whites of his eyes"></div>

<p>“No, Élise,” firmly replied Pierre,
who had much more real courage than
his master, “I promised Mademoiselle
Bouchard that I never would desert
Monsieur Bouchard. If he remains
in the midst of the dangers of the
Rue Bassano he needs my protecting
services more than ever. Although
but a servant, I have a sense
of honor. I cannot break my word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Oh, you old hypocrite—” began
Élise.</p>

<p>“Hypocrite, you may call me,” answered
Pierre, folding his arms and
turning up the whites of his eyes,
“but liar and falsifier
you cannot.
Mademoiselle—”
to Mademoiselle
Bouchard—“I
shall keep my word
to you. As long
as Monsieur Bouchard
remains in
the Rue Bassano
I stay with him.
He shall not face
alone the dangers
of that gay locale—those music halls,
those theatres, those merry cafés, where
all sorts of delicious, indigestible things
are sold. His faithful Pierre shall be
with him.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Bouchard realized she
was beaten. So did Élise. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
rose slowly. De Meneval ran into
the next room, and bringing out a
cage that held the redoubtable Pierrot,
put it into Mademoiselle Bouchard’s
hand.</p>

<p>“There, dear Aunt Céleste,” he
cried, “is your consoler. I offered
to buy him from the proprietor of the
Pigeon House, but the man said he
would give me the bird for nothing—in
fact, he would pay to get rid of
him. He was driving the customers
of the Pigeon House away by his
language.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said Mademoiselle
Bouchard, solemnly, “if men are
renegades, there is something of the
same sex that is faithful and grateful.
No doubt this poor bird is happy at
escaping from the dissipated atmosphere
of the Pigeon House to the
sweet seclusion of the Rue Clarisse.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_257">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_257.jpg" alt="Forcing the cage door open with almost
human intelligence, flew out">
</figure>

<p>But, horror of horrors! The instant
the wicked Pierrot found himself
going in the direction of the
door, on his way to the Rue Clarisse,
he broke out into the most outrageous
denunciations of the two ladies.
Shrieks, demoniac laughter, yells,
oaths and slang of the worst description
poured from him; he screamed
with rage, bit furiously at both Mademoiselle
Bouchard and Élise, and
forcing the cage door open, with almost
human intelligence flew out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
perched on Monsieur Bouchard’s
shoulder, from which he continued
his volley of abuse, winding up with
a shout of:</p>

<p>“Go to the devil, you bowlegged
old rapscallions!”</p>

<p>But the two respectable elderly persons
so infamously described, were
already fleeing. Of course, no such
bird as Pierrot had become could be
tolerated in the Rue Clarisse, and Élise
cried, while she and Mademoiselle
Bouchard ran down the stairs:</p>

<p>“The only safe thing to do, Mademoiselle,
is to keep everything masculine
out of our apartment. They are
all alike—men and parrots—everything
that is masculine is abominable
and not to be trusted. They live to
deceive us poor women, and are never
so happy as when they are lying to us.
So let them go—Monsieur, Pierre and
Pierrot—the wretches, and trust to
retributive justice to overtake them!”</p>

<p>But neither Monsieur Bouchard nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Pierre seemed to fear the blindfolded
lady with the sword. They were at
that moment capering with glee, and
Pierre was shouting:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go back to the Rue
Clarisse for a million of monkeys!”</p>

<p>And Papa Bouchard was saying:</p>

<p>“I have a confession to make. It
is this—that I like a gay life, and as
that worthy fellow says, I would not
go back to the Rue Clarisse for a
million of monkeys, and all the money
in the Bank of France beside. I intend
to lead a <i>very</i> gay life, hereafter.
I am a changed, a reformed man.
Léontine, I shall allow you three-fourths
of your income to spend—and
if you get into straits, come to Papa
Bouchard and perhaps I’ll do something
handsome. Victor, when next
you have a little party of Pouters on
hand, don’t forgot your Papa Bouchard.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t,” cried de Meneval,
“and Fallière and I will promise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to get twenty of the best fellows in the
regiment and take you on the biggest
lark, bat, jag, and jamboree you ever
heard of in all your life!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_260">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_260.jpg" alt="Free! Free! gay dogs are we!">
</figure>

<p>“Pray don’t forget,” answered Papa
Bouchard, while his mouth came open
as if it were on hinges. “Remember—it
is to have all the combined features
of a lark, a bat, a jag and a jamboree.
And Pierre, my man, we won’t go
back to the Rue Clarisse!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“No!” shrieked Pierre, capering
in an ecstasy of delight, “we won’t go
back to the Rue Clarisse!”</p>

<p>And Pierrot yelled as if inspired,
“We won’t go back to the Rue Clarisse!
We’re free! we’re free! Gay
dogs are we!”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
